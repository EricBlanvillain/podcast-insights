  "full_text": "- For the vast majority\nof human existence. We've been nomadic and we've\ndone these kind of wider or tighter nomadic circles, depending on the geographic\nregion, but they'd move. So once humans figured out\nhow to stay in a place, that's the initial trigger to what would become civilization. - I think you said beauty and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec. - What I meant by that is they\nwere absolutely comfortable with human sacrifice and, you know, ripping people's hearts out. They had this just, you know,\ngrotesque, violent bent. But in the same way, they also absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry and music and dance. The same Aztec king who\nwould order the hearts of a thousand people\nextracted also would stand up at dinner parties to\nrecite his own poetry, but they were really\njust surgical about it. They'd use a thick obsidian knife where they could just break the\nribs right along the sternum and then push the sternum\ndown, pull up and just. - While the person was alive? - Yep, while the person was alive. - The following is a\nconversation with Ed Barnhart, an archeologist specializing\nin ancient civilizations of South America, Mesoamerica\nand North America. This is the \"Lex Fridman\nPodcast,\" to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ed Barnhart. Do you think there are lost\ncivilizations in the history of humans on Earth, which we\ndon't know anything about? - Yes, I do, and in fact, you know, we have found some civilizations\nthat we had no idea about, just in my lifetime. I mean, we've got go Gobekli Tepi and we've got the stuff\nthat's going on in the Amazon and there's some other\nless startling things that we had no idea existed\nand pushed our dates back and give us whole new\ncivilizations we had no idea about. So yeah, it's happened and\nI think it'll happen again. - Do you think there's a lost\ncivilization in the Amazon that the Amazon jungle has eaten up or is hiding the evidence of? - Yes, I do, and we're\nbeginning to find it. There are these huge,\nwhat we call geoglyphs, these mound groups that\nare in geometric patterns. I think that the average Joe, when they hear the word civilization, they think of something\nthat looks like Rome. And I don't think we're\never gonna find anything that looks like Rome in the Amazon. I think a lot of things there, I mean, wherever you are on the planet, you use your natural resources. And in the Amazon, there's\nnot a whole lot of stone. What stone is there is deep, deep, deep. So a lot of their things\nwere built out of dirt and trees and feathers and textiles. - But is it possible that all\nthat land that's not covered by trees is actually hiding stone? For example, some\narchitecture, some things that's just very difficult\nto find for archeologists. - I think at the base of the\nAndes where the Amazon connects to the Andes, there's a\nlot of potential there 'cause that's where the stone\nactually starts poking up. When you get down into\nthe basin, stone is meters and meters under the ground\nexcept for a stray cliff here and there where the river dug deep. And even then, only in the dry season 'cause that river rises like over a hundred feet every year. - Well, that's one of the\nthings, having visited that area, just interacting with waterfalls and seeing the water, I was\nhumbled by the power of water to shape landscapes and probably erase history in the context that we're talking about of civilizations, as water can just make\neverything disappear over a period of centuries and millennia. And so if something existed\na very long time ago, thousands of years ago, it's very possible it was\njust eaten up by nature. - Absolutely, in fact, in my opinion, that's almost a certainty\nin a lot of places. You know, the Grand\nCanyon was dug by water. There's this wimpy little\nriver in it right now, and you can't possibly imagine\nthat it dug that, but it did. The power of nature and geology\nis really kind of magical. And when it comes to, you\nknow, ancient civilizations that could be from a long time\nago, there's probably a lot that are just under the ocean. And just the wave action\nhave destroyed them and what they haven't\ndestroyed buried deep. - Under the ocean. So you think Atlantis ever existed? - I don't think that Atlantis existed. I do think it was one of Plato's many parables\ntalking about, you know, putting it in an interesting story as a teaching device in his school. If one did exist or a shadow of it, my money would be on Akrotiri. Akrotiri is what's left of a big city that was on the island of Santorini. And when their volcano blew\nup, it blew up most of the city and shot chunks of it so fast that 70 miles away in Crete, there are chunks of\nSantorini in their cliff. So it blasted what was ever there. But what's left on the side\nof the crater, Akrotiri, is strangely advanced for its age. And so if there's anything\nthat's a model for Atlantis, as Plato explained it, it's Akrotiri. - Akrotiri, the ancient Greek city. So it says the settlement was destroyed in the Theran eruption sometime\nin the 16th century BCE and buried in volcanic ash,\nwhich preserved the remains of the frescoes and many\nobjects and artworks. So we don't know how advanced\nthat civilization was. - No, but we can walk around the ruins and see that it's got\nstreets, it's got plumbing, it's got little sconces\nfor torches at night. It was a vibrant city\nwith a lot of, especially in terms of hydraulic engineering. It's very advanced for\nbeing 3,500 years old. - So if you check out, here's an image of the excavation, what a project. - It's an amazing place. And you can tell that it's just part of it because it's pretty close\nto where the crater begins. So the city itself was\nprobably much larger. - So in this case,\nthere's a lot of evidence. But like we said, there could be civilizations\nthat there is no, there's very little evidence of, because of the natural environment that destroys all the evidence. - And I think Akrotiri is\nactually a great example of that because here we have\nthe side that did preserve, that looks amazing, but we know there was more of the city that was completely obliterated. It was shot, chunks of\nthat city are probably in the walls of Crete 70 miles away. And you know, Plato says that it sunk, it was on an island and it sunk. Well that's exactly what\nhappened to Akrotiri. - You think this is what\nPlato was referring to? - If it does exist, at\nleast the model of it, I think this is probably\nwhat he was talking about. - And there could be other civilizations of which Plato has never written? - Absolutely.\n- That we have no record of. And it's humbling to think\nthat entire civilizations with all the dreams, the hope,\nthe technological innovation, the wars, the conflicts,\nthe political tensions, all of that, the social\ninteractions, the hierarchies, all of that, the art can\nbe just destroyed like that and forgotten, completely\nlost to ancient history. - I reflect upon that\noften as an archeologist. I think about this great\ncountry that I live in and love and all the\nthings we've achieved. But you know, we're a baby\nhistorically speaking. We've been around 200 years. Heck, a lot of the\ncities I study in Central and South America, they had\na run of, you know, 800, a thousand years and now they're ruins. But we're barely getting started in terms of historical civilizations. - So humans, homo sapiens evolved, but they didn't start\ncivilizations right away. There's a long period of time when they did not form\nthese complex societies. So how do we, let's say\n300,000 years ago in Africa actually go from there to\ncreating civilizations? - I think that a lot of human evolution had to do with the pressures that their environment put upon them. And you know, a lot of\nthings start changing right around 12,000 years ago. And that's when, you know,\nour last ice age really ended. And I think there was\na whole lot of things that just pressured them into,\nespecially finding new ways of subsistence. Here in the Americas, a huge thing that happened was\nall the megafauna went away. When the climate changed\nenough, the mammoths died out and the bison died out. And there was just, they had to come up with different ways of doing things. We were hunters and gatherers and we had things we got from hunting and we got things we got from gathering. And in the Americas when the things that they were used to hunting went away and they had to make do with\nrabbits there, you know, the gathering started to be\na much more important thing. And I think that led to figuring out, hey, we could actually\ngrow certain things. And gardens turned into crops,\nturned into intensive crops, and then people were allowed\nto gather in bigger groups and survive in a single area. They didn't have to roam around anymore. And that's where we get the\nfirst sedentary communities, which means they stayed in\nthe same place all year long. For the vast majority of human existence, we've been nomadic and we've\ndone these kind of wider or tighter nomadic circles, depending on the geographic\nregion where they'd know, okay, you know, in the mountains, we'll be in the summer, in the mountains 'cause there's berries and things. And then in the winter we'll be down here and we'll hunt, but they'd move. So once humans figured out\nhow to stay in a place, I think that's the initial trigger too, what would become civilization. - What do you think is, there's a lot of questions\nI wanna ask here. What do you think is the\nmotivation for societies? Is it the carrot or the stick? So you said like, is it, well,\nlike when resources run out, when the old way of life is\nno longer feeding everybody, then you have to figure stuff out. Or is it more the carrot of\nlike, there's always this kind of human spirit that wants to explore, that wants to maybe impress\nthe rest of the village or something like this with\nthe new discovery they made in venturing out and coming\nout with different ideas or technological\ninnovation, let's call it? - Well, you know, I have\nan explorer's heart, so I'm kind of, you know, I'm biased. You know, I do think that we have an innate desire\nto see what's on the horizon. And to impress other people with our achievements, things like that. We're social beings. That's really the edge that humans have is our ability to work together. So I think that it's much more\nthe carrot than the stick. When things get ugly, the stick comes out. But usually the carrot does the job. - The really interesting story is how the first people came to the Americas. I mean, to me that's pretty\ngangster to go from Asia all the way potentially\nduring the ice age, maybe at the end of the ice age or during that whole period, not knowing what the world looks like\ngoing into the unknown. Can you talk through that process? How did the first people\ncome to the Americas? - Well, first off, I agree with you. That was pretty gangster. I mean, that's a hard place to live. I listened to some of your podcasts. Is that guy Jordan Jonas? He cut the mustard, but I wouldn't have\nmade it crossing there. - Well there you go, like the fact that those guys exist, that somebody like Jordan Jonas\nexists, people that survive and thrive in these harsh conditions, that's an indication that it's possible. But yeah, so when do you think, and how did the first people come? - The traditional theories\nare still somewhat valid, or at least you know,\non the table that when that land bridge occurred,\nthat nomadic hunters just followed the game\nlike they always had and the game went across there\n'cause there was no barrier and they followed them across. The thing that has changed\nis how early that happened. DNA has been a total game\nchanger for archeology. You know, we get all\nthese evolutionary tracks that we could never see before. When I was a young archeologist, I would've never dreamed we'd have the information we have now. And that information, a\nlot of it's coming out of Texas A&M, we see the traditional like 12,500 years ago that\nthere was a migration. But now we're seeing one that's almost certainly happening closer to 30,000 years ago. And now the thing that seems like madness, but might be true is that it\ncould have been as early as 60, a lot of the DNA things are suggesting that the very first migration could have come across as early as 60. And when I was a younger archeologist, it was heresy to go beyond this 12,500. You were a wacko if you said that, but now it's really very\nclear that they came over at least by 30,000 and the bridge opened and closed and open and closed. - That's during the ice age.\n- Right. - I mean, that's crazy,\nright, that is crazy. - Yeah, I mean, you\nknow, they didn't roll in and immediately make New\nYork, but there were people and there were definitely not people here before that, which is fascinating. When the bridge closed, DNA mutated. And so we have specific\nkinds of haplogroup that are here in the Americas\nthat don't exist otherwise. And that same haplogroup\ngame has been showing us more and more that people came across Siberia. That it's not Africa,\nit's not Western Europe. Those are still, you\nknow, they've become kind of fringe theories, but\nthey're not totally eradicated. DNA is a developing science as well. And I think we all need\nto keep that in mind, that it's not like they\njust cracked the code and now we know all the answers. And sometimes, like in any science, a breakthrough puts us two\nsteps backwards, not forwards. So I think, you know, we don't\nneed to have too much faith in the models that are now\nbeing created through DNA, but they are pointing in the direction of everybody came across from Siberia that all Native American people are of Asiatic descent. - Do you think it was a gradual process if it's like 30 to 60,000 years ago? Was it just gradual movement\nof these nomadic tribes as they follow the animals? Or was it like one explorer that pushed the tribe\nto just go, go, go, go and go across maybe\nacross a hundred years, travel all the way across maybe into North America,\ninto North, North America where Canada is now, and then sort of like big leaps in movement\nversus gradual movement? - I think it was big leaps and now this is just,\nyou know, mostly guess, I'll admit, but I think that\nit much in the way that a lot of our evolutionary models talk about punctuated equilibrium, that\nthere are big moments of change and then it settles out into a more slow and steady pattern and then\nsomething big will happen again. I do think that the\nearly people went as far as they could go, and\nthere were certain colonies that just got isolated\nfor thousands of years. One of the fascinating things\nthat DNA is showing us, which actually blood types were showing us way before that, is that the oldest people in the\nAmericas are in South America. The ones that got separated early and didn't mix their DNA,\nlike the people in the Amazon, most of those guys have O blood type and they're haplogroup D,\nwhich is the oldest one that entered the US and what\nare they doing down there? I do believe they came\nacross the Bering Strait, I don't think it's very,\nwe have no real evidence to say they came in mass across Oceania. So they made it probably\nby boat along the coast, all the way to South America. - So there's some kind of cultural engine that drove them to explore. So if you had to bet all your money, it happened like tens of\nthousands of years ago. But in a very rapid pace,\nthere's these explorers, they went all the way to South America and there established their\nkind of more stable existence. And from there, South\nAmerica, Mesoamerica, North America was kind of\ngradually expanded into that area. - I think the next waves came down and did North America and Central America. And the very first wave\nmade it all the way down to South America and got isolated there, and then mixed in with\nthe next groups that came. - That's fascinating.\n- Kinda like there's, there's an interesting correlate in Europe where today everybody feels like Celtic people are from Ireland, but actually Celtic people\nstarted in Eastern Europe and it was the entire area. And when Rome kind of swept everything and Rome was now the ruler of the day, it was only that far edge\nof the Celtic world, Ireland that they were like,\nah, we're not gonna mess with those guys on that island. We'll leave them be, so now\nit looks like that's the heart of Celtic tradition, but\nactually it's the fringe. - So if it is 60,000 years ago, these are really early humans. - Yeah, and there were consistent things that have been coming out for decades about very old Carbon\n14 dates in the Amazon and in the Andes area that\neverybody just dismissed. It's, no, it didn't get\na date of 40,000 years, but I think we're gonna come back around to start readdressing some of these based on new evidence at hand. - And that's the interesting\nthing is, you know, the early human spread\nthroughout the world and then like you said,\nperhaps have gotten isolated and then civilization sprung from there and they all have similar elements even though they were isolated. That's really interesting. That's really interesting\nthat there's multiple cradles of civilization, not just\none, like one good idea, that those ideas naturally come up. Those structures naturally come up. - And I wonder whether,\nyou know, the similarities that all those cradles\nhave, it could be, you know, a shared much deeper\npast that they all have. Or it could be a more kind\nof Star Trek thing where, you know, captain Kirk was always talking about the theory of\nparallel human development, that humans across the universe\ngo through certain stages of development and that that\ncould be the answer to it. - Which one do you lean on? Which one do you lean towards? - I think it's a case by case thing. I think if we look globally, I'd lean much more towards the\nhuman parallel development. But if I look just to the Americas, and we have a shorter time\nperiod where, you know, the things that become\nmajor civilizations, now I'll say, you know,\nup to 30,000 years ago, which is still a blip\nin the time of humans, I think that there were shared things that those people came\nover with from Asia, and that as they got separated,\nthat they had core values that then turned into things like religion and cultural customs that we can see. I'm a big proponent that\nthere are commonalities in all the cultures of the\nAmericas that lead back to and point to a single distant origin. - You've spoken about the lost cradle of civilization, South America. So South America is not often talked about as one of the cradles of civilization. So South America,\nMesoamerica, can you explain? - Well, we have very early\nstuff in South America. You're right, I mean,\nyou know, especially, as an American, our country's so big and you know, that we are so\nfar removed from these places, we don't even think about it. But more and more we're\nseeing things that predate the earliest stuff that\nwe like to talk about, like Egypt and Mesopotamia. There are things, it's\nall on the Peruvian coast that we have these\ncradles of civilization. Someday we might start\ntalking about the Amazon more and more, but right now\nwhat we've got are things that date back into\nthe three thousands BCE along the coast of Peru. And there are big stone\nbuilt pyramids and temples and they're amazingly isolated, even now that we've found them. Some of them, like Caral is one of the most famous ones\njust north of Lima. We've known about it for\na couple decades now, how old it is. But every time I visit there,\nit's like I visited the moon, there's absolutely nobody there. Not for miles. It's amazing how such a discovery was made and yet still nobody goes to see it. It's not easy to get to. - So you think there's a\nbunch of locations like that. Some may not have been\ndiscovered in the Peru area. - Oh, there are so many, Peru has tons, that desert gets really ugly quick and it buries things completely. There are so many pyramids out there that are still completely untouched. You know, when people\nhear the name pyramids, they think of Egypt immediately. But Egypt has got about 140 pyramids, and we have pretty much found them all. Peru has thousands, thousands of pyramids. And now they weren't built of a lot, not all of them were built of stones. Some of them were adobe bricks, which have weathered terribly. So now they don't look, they're not exciting\nplaces to visit today. You know what's funny too, you know, we started off talking about, you know, whether I think there's a\nlost civilization out there, there are definitely things\nthat are still to be discovered, but there are some things that were discovered a hundred\nyears ago and archeologists or back then, they called\nthemselves antiquarians just kind of passed over. Caral was one of these sites because the coast of Peru\nhas some of those pyramids that were made by the\nMoche are full of gold and beautiful ceramics. And you know, things that\nyou can sell for big money, but Caral was found a long time ago, but the archeologist\nwas like, God, no gold, no ceramics, forget about it. This place is no good, we\ncan't sell anything here. And then about the 1970s or eighties, somebody said, hey, no ceramics, is that older than the\ninvention of ceramics. Shit, we better go take\nanother look at that place. - So what's the dating on Caral? - Caral I think starts at about 3,200 BCE and it lasts as a major\ncivilization with a lot of other cities around\nit, until about 1800 BCE. - So what's the story behind, like looking at some of these images? What's the story about\nconstructions like that? What was the idea? - That thing, isn't that amazing? Oh that, gosh. I mean, it should be\nsome sort of, you know, I'll be a flaky\narcheologist, like, you know, this is a place where rituals took place. So many things we say are\nso just painfully vague. And that's about, you know, what we got. And a place like this. I know the one we're looking at here, I've been here a couple of times. In the pyramid behind it,\nthe rubble's built in a way where the building won't rock apart. This is a very earthquake prone place, but the buildings haven't fallen because they make these net baskets of rocks inside that\nall kinda wiggle around and don't allow the building to fall down. And inside these, we've also\nfound a couple of things that were babies, that were human babies that were buried in there. And I don't think, there's a lot of people that see that and go, oh, look at that. They were sacrificing\nbabies, these monsters. I think a lot of the\nthings that are interpreted as baby sacrifices, Caral's\nevidence being one of them, I think it's more about the tragic nature of infant mortality, in the past it was a lot more common. There were cultures\nthat didn't even really properly name their kid\nuntil they got to five because chances were they were gonna die. And so I think a lot of these babies that we find in these ceremonial contexts that are interpreted as sacrifices, I think they're putting\nthem in special places because they mourn the death of their kids and it just happened a\nlot more frequently then. - One of the things you said\nthat really surprised me is that pyramids were built in\nPeru, possibly hundreds of years before they were built in Egypt. Is that true? - Absolutely, absolutely,\nin fact, there's. - That's crazy.\n- There's one that's now pushing 6,000 BCE, like that's thousands of years\nbefore the stuff in Egypt and that one's called Huaca Prieta. And it was not a, it was\nnot an Egyptian pyramid. But it was a pyramid and it was thousands of years before. - What do you think is the\nmotivation to build a pyramid? The fact that it can withstand\nthe elements structurally, that kind of thing, is it? Why do humans build pyramids and why do they build it in all kinds of different locations in the world? - Well, you know, my root\nanswer is pretty boring really. A lot of people ask me, why are there pyramids\nall over the planet? How is that, is that a\ncoincidence, I mean, who? I think that when people wanted to build a big building\nwithout rebar or cement, you end up building\nsomething with a fat base that goes up to a skinny top\nand that turns into a pyramid. You know, any kid who's playing with blocks on the floor\nbuilds a couple towers and his brother knocks them down. And if he wants one that's\ngonna stay and be tall, he ends up making\nsomething with a fat base and a tiny top. And I think that, you know,\nbuilding something big and tall together is one\nof those human things. Like we built that, that will\nbe here after we're gone. People remember who we were. We are all, if there's\nany human commonality, it's fear of our own deaths\nand that we were nothing and no one will ever remember us. I think that the first big\nmonuments like that were probably a group of people saying\nwe're gonna do something that people will remember forever. Now that being said, you\nremember we were just talking about Huaca Prieta and this one that's almost 6,000 BC\nnow is the first one. That one's a funny case. We just talked about\nall these lofty goals, but actually I'm pretty sure that Huaca Prieta's first\npyramid was about capping a smelly pile of trash. I think everybody piled up their trash in the middle of town. And it stunk, it's on the\ncoast, it stunk like fish. And somebody said, if we just\nbury this thing with dirt, it won't smell anymore. And then it was a big mound\nwhere people could get up and talk to everybody and\nthen said, well, it's squishy, you know, if we cap it with clay, then it will really not smell. I really think that\nthe very first pyramids in Peru were about trash management. Talk about deflating, huh? - Yeah, but then they probably saw it and they were impressed\nand humbled by the sort of the enormity of the construction. And then they're like, oh, we should, maybe the next guy thought maybe we should keep building these kinds of things. - Yeah, yeah, not to jump ahead, but in North America, you know, where they also made pyramids. There's this interesting evolution where there were these\npiles of shells along rivers and along the coastlines,\npeople ate a lot of shells. That was an easy thing to collect and eat. So these piles of shells\nwould be near communities and they probably became landmarks, but eventually they\nstarted burying their dead inside those too, probably\nagain, you know, about stink and about, you know, well we\ndon't want the dogs to eat 'em. Maybe we put 'em in the\nmiddle of the shell pile. But then that all of a\nsudden became this like, that's where my grandfather's body is. That's where great grandfather's body is. And all of a sudden people\nstarted being attached to place, not just for the resources, but for the shared memories\nof their ancestors. So when the very first pyramid was built in Ohio area by the Adena\npeople, it was built outta dirt, but it's full of bodies. And I think it's an echo of\na old thing where they used to be putting bodies in shell mounds. - So where and who were\nthe first civilizations in South America, Mesoamerica? - Well, you know, I think we're\nstill piecing that together. Coming back to the first\nthings we talked about, I think we're still\nmissing a lot of stuff, especially in South America. It just keeps getting older and older. Part of the reason it's hard\nto answer that question is, you know, at what point\ndo we consider people a civilization or a culture? We have in the Americas\nthis long period of time that we call the Paleo Indian time where they were hunting megafauna. And then when those went away, we get into this even longer period of time called the archaic, where they're just hunters and gatherers. Sometimes somebody's coming up with a cool different kind of arrowhead. They go back and forth with\ndifferent hunting tools, but really nothing changes\nfor thousands of years. And then finally they start developing into these larger groups,\nwhich for the most part has to do with agriculture,\nit used to be archeology. That was just the end all,\nbe all, civilization starts with the invention of agriculture. And we can't have sedentary communities until people learn how to farm. But that's been discounted. Peru was a big part of\nthat, that area of Caral. It's connected to another city\non the coast called Aspero. And Aspero starts about the same time, but they're all about fishing. They have no farming. And Caral who's up river\nfrom them is farming. But funny enough, they're\nnot really farming food. They're farming cotton\nand they're making nets and they're trading the nets with the people on the coast for the fish. So it's not as simple as it's\njust agriculture anymore. But it is, I think, still rooted in how can we feed more people\nthan just our family? How can we together\ncreate a food abundance so we're no longer scared\nabout running out of food? - So is it possible, which\nis something you've argued that civilization started in the Amazon, in the jungle versus the coast? - I think so, I think religion in South America began in the Amazon. I think there were people there, very old. There's actually the\nearliest pottery in all of the Americas of all these places that we have civilizations\nthat grew up, you know, where the oldest pottery is? The middle Of the Amazon. - So there's interesting cultures\ndeveloping in the Amazon. So religion, you would\nsay preceded civilization? - In South America, Caral and Aspero, that I was just talking about. It's weird what a dearth of art and any evidence of religion\nwe have, we have those pyramids and things that we call temples, but we don't really know\nwhat went on in there. And there's no hints of\nreligious iconography, ceremonies, nothing like that. The first stuff that we get is right when that culture ends about 1800 BCE, this culture called\nChavin starts up and they, their main temple is up in the Andes. And this place of path of least resistance between\nthe Amazon and the coast. It's about three days walk\neither way from this place where this temple is, that's where we start seeing the very\nfirst religious iconography. And it's all over the temples. There are things that are\ndefinitely from the coast, but the iconography are\nall jaguars and snakes and crocodiles, and those\ndon't come from the coast. All of those things are\ncoming out of the Amazon. - Religion is a really powerful idea. Religions are one of\nthe most powerful ideas. They're the strongest myths\nthat tie people together. And to you, it's possible\nthat this powerful idea in South America started in the Amazon. - I do, I do think it did. And you're right, you know, ideas are more powerful than weapons, but archeology can't see them at all. We can see, sometimes we\ncan see ideas manifesting in the things they create and lead to, but there's an interpretation problem. Are we right about what idea created this? That those are things that\narcheology just can't get at. - That's one of the\nchallenges of archeology and looking into ancient histories. You're trying to not just understand what they were doing in\nterms of architecture, but understand what was\ngoing on inside their mind. - That's really what I'm in it for, trying to understand these people and it's real detective work and we know we're dealing\nwith a totally flawed record. We only have what could\npreserve the test of time. You know, if we look\naround this room here, if 2000 years of weathering\nhappened in this room, what would be left and what\nwould we think happened here? - Right, right, right. But there's not in this room, but if you look at\nthousands of rooms like it, maybe you can start to\npiece things together about the different ideologies\nthat ruled the world, the religions, the different ideas. Tell me about this fanged deity. One of your more controversial ideas is that you believe that the religions, there's a thread that connects\nthe different civilizations to societies of the Indian region and the religion that\npractice is more monotheistic than is currently believed\nin the mainstream. - That is exactly what I think. And I think it's all\nabout this fanged deity who somewhere thousands of\nyears ago crawled his way out of the Amazon up into the\nAndes and a religion took hold. That could have been kind of a combination of ideas from the coast and the Amazon. But he is the one creator deity, in my opinion, through\nall of these cultures. And the people in the\nAmazon still talk about him. There his name is Vijomase in some groups. But they say that his emissaries\non Earth are the jaguars and that he is the creator deity. - Why is the current\nmainstream belief is that a lot of the religions are not monotheistic? - Well, there are bonafide pantheons. You know, Greece had one, Egypt had one, Mesopotamia had one. Lots of the early religions of the old world were pantheons. And I think that was part of the problem. The earliest archeologists walked in there with a preconceived notion that ancient cultures have pantheons. And so they went to the\nart looking for them and they came up with\nthings like the shark god and the moon goddess and the\nsun God and all these things. But when I look at the art, and I was trained by a person\nright here in Austin, Texas as an art historian, you follow certain\ndiagnostic traits through art to see the development over time. And when I look at it and use that methodology,\nthere's a single face with goggle eyes and fangs and\nclaws on his hands and feet and snakes coming off of his\nhead and off of his belt. He's got really identifiable traits. He also likes to sever people's heads off and carry them around. But he's the fanged deity and he's there, he shows\nup in Chavin de Huantar, the capital of that Chavin culture. And he keeps showing up\nthrough every culture, even thousands of miles away throughout the next two millennium, right up to the Inca. The Inca have a creator\ndeity, they call Viracocha. But Viracocha is the fanged deity. When we do see him, by\nthe time you get to Inca, they do this kind of\nlike almost Islamic thing where they say you can't\nunderstand the face of Viracocha. So when they do put him in a cosmogram, they'll make him just a blob. Like he's just unknowable,\nbut he's at the very top. I think we're misunderstanding\na lot of things that we used to say were deities as\njust supernatural beings. If we flip the mirror on Christianity and take a look at it, which of course Christianity's\nmonotheistic, right, it would be heresy to say otherwise. But who are all these other characters? Who are all these angels and demons and you know, Jesus Christ and I mean, I don't even\nknow who the Holy Spirit is, but he's some sort of supernatural being. But it's that monotheistic\nsystem has lots of things that have supernatural\npowers that are not God. That's where I think the crux of us misunderstanding\nancient Andean art is. - So what is the process of\nanalyzing art through time to try to figure out what the important entities\nare for that culture? Do you just see what shows up over and over and over and over? - Well, certainly without\nthe advent of writing, depictions in art have all sorts of meanings encoded in them. And there are certain, you know, what we call diagnostic elements. Like we can pull apart the same sort of thing in like in the\nGreek pantheon, you know, you know by their dress\nand what they're holding, what the different gods are. You can tell Hades from Zeus by the different things\nthey're holding, you know, lightning bolts or\ntridents or whatever it is. So they all have these\ndiagnostic elements to them. So that's how art history goes about analyzing art over time. Once we can put it in a\nchronological sequence, then we can say, okay, here's a deity here in Chavin culture. Now we move forward 500\nyears, now we're in Moche and Nazca culture, you know, where are the deities here? And what I see is that\nsame guy with not just one or two traits, but a whole package of them that shows up again and again and again for thousands\nof years in each one of these cultures, he's got circular eyes, he's got a fanged mouth, he's got claws on his hands and feet. He's a humanoid, but he also has snakes coming\noff of his head, like hair and snakes coming off of his belt. And then not so much in Chavin, but as it goes forward,\nhe starts carting around severed heads, human severed heads. So they're like, in the old literature, the Moche will call him\nthe decapitator deity. But then they have these other like, oh, here's the crab deity\nand here's the fox deity. But if you look at them,\nlike the crab deity is just that guy's face coming off of a crab. And the fox deity is that\nguy's face coming off of a fox. So I think on that particular instance, I explained it similar to what Zeus did. You know how Zeus was\nable to like, you know, turn into whatever animal he wanted to get with the woman he wanted. And he showed up in all sorts of forms. But he was always Zeus. I think that the fanged\ndeity manifests himself through people and animals\nthroughout the art. And that there are missing\nstories of mythology that we don't have anymore. - And across hundreds of years, thousands of years from Chavin to Moche\nto Inca as you're saying. - Right, Wari has them too. Tiwanaku, that famous place Pumapunku, he's all over there. - I wonder how those\nideas spread and morph of this fanged deity. - I think people walked and proselytized and places like Chavin, there's a later one in Inca\ntimes called Pachacamac that are pilgrimage places\nwhere people come in to be healed if they're sick, but also just to pay homage\nto the powers that be. So Chavin was a place where\npeople from the Amazon and people from the coast\nwere all coming together. In fact, we saw it in\nthe archeology there. There's these interesting\nlabyrinths under the pyramids with the fanged deity all\nover them that have like, one labyrinth will have all pottery. The next labyrinth will have\na bunch of animal bones. The next one will have a bunch\nof things made outta stone. So people are showing up\nand giving this tribute and they're learning and then they're going\nback to their community. So I think it dispersed from\ncertain pilgrimage spots and became just like pilgrimage spots do. Somebody goes back and they build a temple to the fanged deity. - Do we know much about\nthe relationship they had with the fanged deity\nand like their conception of the powers of the fanged deity? Were they afraid of the fanged deities and all knowing God? Is it something that\nbrings joy and harvest or is it something that you're\nsupposed to be afraid of and sacrifice animals and\nhumans to keep at bay? - I think he had two sides of the coin. Like a lot of the Hindu\ngods are, you know, one aspect is terrible,\nthe other aspect is lovely. I think he had that\nsame sorts of qualities 'cause we do see him as a fierce warrior\ntaking people's heads off. And he is a jaguar, which in and of itself implies a\ncertain power and ferocity. But then there are other\nfunny things about him. Like he is definitely involved in a lot of healing ceremonies and a lot of those healing\nceremonies are involved with sex acts, when it comes to the Moche, there's this whole group of sexual pottery where\npriests are having sex with women or men. And some of them show\ntheir faces transforming into that fanged deity. Like he is acting through them. But the thing that most cracks me up that shows his softer side is the fanged deity has a little puppy. He has a puppy that's like\njust dancing around his feet and like jumping up on\nhim in various scenes. They see him again and again. Sometimes he's in these\nhealing sex scenes. In fact, I tracked that\npuppy from other contexts to these sex scenes where\na priest was having sex with somebody in a house\nand there's a fanged deity and there's a puppy just\nscratching at the door like, hey, you forgot me. And then finally one day I found one with the puppy having sex with the woman instead of the fanged deity. I was like, oh, he really\nis very involved in this. What is this weird puppy? So yeah, he likes to take heads off, but he also has a puppy he adores. - Actually this awesomely makes sense now because I saw the opening of a paper you wrote 30\nyears ago on shamanism and Moche civilization. It reads \"the Moche are the\nmajor focus of this paper, sex, puppies and headhunting\nwill be shown to be related to ancient Moche shamanism.\" So now I understand, I was\nlike, well, the puppies? - [Ed] Yeah, it's true. - And the headhunting,\nthat's the decapitate aspect. - And I've added rock and roll\nto that list since actually, rock and roll are, you know, music is also a big part of it. - Oh, interesting.\n- They call spirits down. There's this whole spirit world. There's the ancestors and the people that drink\nSan Pedro cactus juice kind of, they don't talk about\nthe fanged deity anymore. I think Christianity in 500 years has somewhat put him in the back. You know, it was unpopular\nto have a pagan deity. So they don't talk about him much anymore, though he's still around. They're in like around\nTrujillo, they call him Aiapec. But music play in the\nAmazon, they play flutes. Sometimes a chorus of women sing and that's supposed to\nbring the spirits down into the ceremony. There's a spirit that's\nhurting the person that's sick. And then the priest or the\nshaman or the curandero, whatever you wanna call him,\nhas his own posse of spirits that are gonna help him\nfigure out what's going on. So when the music starts, that's bringing those spirits in and people don't see them unless they've imbibed the\nSan Pedro Cactus Juice, which is the hallucinogen, which is in the Amazon\nside, it was ayahuasca. On the coast, it was San Pedro Cactus. But that's what allows you to\nactually see that other world. - Yeah, I went to the Amazon recently and did Ayahuasca, a very high dose of it. - Bold move. - When in Rome. How far back does that go? - Oh, I think longer than\nanybody can remember. But I mean, it's a natural\nplant that's been there forever. I think that it's thousands\nand thousands of years. That's another thing Chavin de\nHuantar, I was talking about, where I think the things came, the religion came from the Amazon. There's this wall on the backside that faces the Amazon side. So if you're entering the\ncity from the Amazon path, you see this wall first. And it's a bunch of faces\nthat some of them are human, some of them are total jaguar and some of them are\ntransforming in between. But there's a group of them that are midway through transformation and they show their nostrils\nleaking out this snot that's coming like down their face. San Pedro doesn't do that\nto you, but ayahuasca does. Ayahuasca traditionally,\nthey'd take a blow gun and just shoot it up\nyour nose or up your ass. But a lot of times up your nose. And when it shoots up\nyour nose, the first thing that happens is just this\ngush of snot comes out of you. And there are stone depictions of people uncontrollably snotting on the backside of this temple from, you know, 3000 years ago. - So that you think could\nhave been a big component of the development of\nreligion and shamanism? - I think that hallucinogens\nopened the mind then, like they opened the mind now. - Do you think that, you\nknow, the stoned ape theory, do you think that actually could have been an actual catalyst for the\nformation of civilization? - In the Americas, yes, I do, though, you know, hallucinogens are not part of every ancient tradition in the world. In fact, strangely, the majority of plants that are actually psychotropic,\nnot just mood altering, are from here in the Americas. There are very few drugs that will make you hallucinate\noutside of the Americas. Of course now they're global and you know, they can be\ngrown all over the place. But originally speaking, very, very few were\noutside of the Americas. So they were part of the\nexperience here in a way that they just couldn't\nbe in other places. - I wondered to a degree, they\nwere just part of a ritual and the creative force behind sort of art versus like literally the method by which you come up with ideas\nthat define a civilization. So like the degree to which they had a role in\nthe formation of civilizations. It's kind of fun to think\nabout psychedelics being like a critical role in\nformation of civilizations. - I think in terms of South America, they really were. In North America where we're\nin a more northern climb here and there are less of them,\nnot so much, at least in terms of psychedelics, things like, you know, tobacco was always a big part of it. But a lot of the, you know, there's more than one way to reach a hallucinatory state. The hard way is starvation,\nsleep deprivation. And for the Maya, for example, would go sleep deprivation, starvation, and then they'd cut themselves very badly. And that loss of blood, we\nbelieve triggered hallucinations and visions, nothing to do with drugs. I would much prefer the drugs route. - It's the result, the tools aren't the thing\nthat creates insight. It's the result. - It's that getting to, you know, the hallucinogens are poisoning\nus, they're killing us. That's, you know, it's a near death state. And people of the Americas believed sleeping was entering that other world. Death, you entered this other world and that when you took\nthis mighty dose of poison, it was helping you enter that other world for a period of time. - Yeah, as Tom Waits\nsaid in that one song, \"I like my town with a\nlittle drop of poison.\" So maybe that poison is a\ngood catalyst for invention. So who were the early first\nsort of mother cultures, mother civilizations in South America? And like what is, if we\nlook chronologically, is there a label we can put on the first peoples that emerged? - That picture is evolving. I mean, forever it was\njust the Chavin people that we've been talking about. The ones with all the first depictions of religious art were the mother culture. And they certainly did\ntransmit a lot of stuff, but then all of a sudden we find Caral. The next one that we've\nbarely even begun looking at, but it's probably older than\nCaral is Sachin culture. I was just poking around there last year and just from the bus on the highway, I could see like, that's\na pyramid out there. What, oh, there's another one. And I know how old the stuff\nwe have studied there is, it's again, 3000 BC, we're just barely beginning\nto understand them. Caral frustrates me to no end. The lack of art there\nthat's, we've got, you know, stones and bones and not\neven ceramics to go on. And they didn't have the\ncourtesy to leave me a bunch of art I can interpret. So I don't know what\nthose people believed. - Right, so one of the ways to understand what people believe is looking at the art, the stories told through\nthe art, and then hopefully deciphering if they were\ndoing any kind of writing. - That's our most fruitful place to try to get at these elusive ideas. - Yeah, and it sucks\nwhen they don't have art. If we just go back to the\nAmazon, you've mentioned that it's possible that\nthere's a lost civilization that existed in the Amazon. So it's carried a lot of names,\nLost City of Z or El Dorado. Do you think it's possible it existed? - Well, City of Z and El Dorado are in\npretty different places. El Dorado, the ideas of where it is kind of center around towards Columbia. And the City of Z is named after a region of Brazil called the Xingu. And so those, those are an America worth of distance apart, you know, people don't really think\nabout it on the map, but the entire United States\nwould fit inside the Amazon. That's how big that place is. And these two are on either end, but both of them have\nevidence of civilizations. These big, you know, it's lowland and it floods all the time. So what they did is they'd\nmake these big mounds and then they'd make huge\ncauseways between mounds so they could walk through their cities while they were seasonally inundated. And a bunch of that stuff has\nbeen found in the Xingu area, like huge areas that would support tens of thousands of people. Again, you know, it's not stone built and it's been under the forest forever, so it's very torn up. But it's there now. You know, Brazil is big on cattle farming more than ever now. And a thing that I think\nis completed now is Brazil and Bolivia partnered together and built a highway all the way across and opened up a whole bunch\nmore land, which has found more of these, what we call\nlike geometric earthworks. So there's more and more\nevidence of these civilizations. It's not, it could be\nthere, it's there for sure. - By the way, the people who are trying to protect the rainforest\nreally hate the highway. One of the things I learned is if you build a road, loggers will come. And they'll start cutting stuff down. Now from an archeology\nperspective, if you cut down trees, you get to discover things. But from a sort of protecting very precious rainforest perspective, it's obviously the opposite way. But it is interesting I've\nseen where loggers cut through the forest and when they leave the forest\nheals itself very quickly. - [Ed] So quick, so quickly. - And you know, you just\nthink that across decades, you expand that to centuries\nand it's like you could see how a civilization could\nbe completely swallowed up by the rainforest. - And it happened for sure in the Amazon. You know, one of the\nways that we're trying to push the frontier of where\npeople were in the Amazon 'cause yes, the trees and just the biomass have\neaten so much evidence, but they're finding more and more of these places\nthat they call terra preta, which is black earth and\nthere's huge swaths of it. So I guess the anthropology term is anthropogenic landscapes. And what they're saying is that that really dark earth\ncouldn't have just got that way through natural forest processes that sometime in the distant\npast that forest wasn't there and there was major farming and human activity to the point where they totally turned the soil black and it's much more enriched. And when I took a trip into the Amazon, I went from Manaus up the\nriver, the black river a couple of days and went and met\nsome different communities and I asked them about this black earth and they were like, yeah,\nthat's why we're here. Sometimes we move our village, but when we move we\nlook for the terra preta and that's where we're\ngonna put our village because that's a place that\nall of our gardens work. The other places they don't. - One of the things you\ntalked about literally, you have to ask the right question and the stories, all\nthe secrets that carried by the people and they'll tell you. - Yeah, there's so many of them. You know, a thing that excites the world\nabout archeology right now is Gobekli Tepe and this, you know, 10,000, now\nKarahan Tepe is 11,000. The whole area is called the Tas Tepeler, we only found it a couple of decades ago, but it was just a, you know, a archeologist rowing through the area and ask a sheep herder, hey, you know, you guys know where anything ancient is? Oh yeah, lemme show you this. And then all of a sudden\nwe've got a lost civilization. And the shepherds always\nknew where it was, just nobody asked him. - So speaking of Gobekli Tepe, what do you think about the work of Gram Hancock who also believes that there's a lost\ncivilization in the Amazon? - Well, I've met Graham\nand personally I like him. He's a nice guy, got\na nice sense of humor, and I think he's smart. And I also think he is\na very good researcher. He and I are working on\nthe same set of facts. The differences are interpretations. I do not believe Graham's idea that a single now lost\nancient civilization seeded the rest of them. I just don't see that on a\nnumber of levels, artifact wise, technology wise, art, historical analysis. So I think his research is great. I think that he's very well read, in fact better read than\na lot of my colleagues. But his conclusions I disagree with. And he and I have talked about\nthis and had a very civil and normal conversation about it, and agree to disagree\nwithout spitting any venom at any point in the conversation. - That would be a fun argument\nto be a fly on the wall for. So he believes, he's proposed, it's possible that the Amazon jungle is sort of a manmade garden. So it was planted there by\nadvanced ancient civilization. Is there any degree to which\nthat could be possible? - Frankly, I agree with him. I mean, it's just like what\nI was just talking about, it's the conclusion part\nthat we differ from. But the facts that he's basing that on are that terra preta are the\nhuge geometric earthworks, are the ever increasing evidence of them. They are now from, you know, the bottom of Bolivia to Guyana. They're everywhere. Every time we open up the\njungle, we find these big works. So yes, there was a vast\ncivilization that was there. How advanced they were is a question. And also, you know, a perspective thing. Graham really focuses in\non what we don't know. And what could be. - What's the, just to educate me, what's the key idea that he's proposing that you disagree with? It was the level of advancement\nthe civilization was, or how large and centralized it was? - My main point of\ndisagreement is that his, and his ideas evolve, like everybody's, you know, no scientist or researcher in anything,\nhas an idea at the beginning of their career and holds\nit till the day they die. His ideas are evolving,\nbut his ideas remain, a core of them are that there\nwas a very advanced single, ancient civilization that\nwas utterly destroyed by climactic conditions. And the Younger Dryas\nhypothesis is part of that, most recently, he used to not say that, now he's into this meteor thing, but he believes that that\ncivilization was destroyed, but that members of it\nescaped this cataclysm and then spread out all\nover the world to seed all of the world's civilizations\nfor the next revival. There's where I disagree with him, I think these were independent\ncivilizations that grew up in their own ways, that\nthey were not seeded by some more advanced\ncivilization from the past. And that they all hold things in common because they have this common\nancestry of a, you know, in his early books he\nsuggested it's Atlantis. I don't think he suggests that anymore, but he still hangs on\nto the single advanced, now completely lost civilization\nand, you know, archeology. So we don't have, you know, all of our ideas are theories. Very few of them are facts, and we're not, you know, we\ncould have the story wrong, but one thing we're real\ngood at is finding stuff. I mean, we find fish\nscales, so I find it just too big a pill to swallow\nthat there was a civilization that was that technologically advanced and that large that we can't\neven find a potsherd from. - Yeah, and of course,\nit is a compelling story that there's a single\ncivilization from which all of this came from, because\nthe alternative is, you know, the idea that we came\nacross the Bering Strait from Asia, went all the\nway down to South America and got isolated and created all these marvelous,\nsophisticated civilizations and ideas, including religious\nideas that look similar to other, you know,\neverybody has a flood myth. So like, there's a lot of similarities. Everybody building pyramids. But there could be a lot\nof other explanations and even if it's a simple,\ncompelling explanation that has to be evidence for it, right. And what would that evidence look like? - Well, that's the bottom line. I mean, everything's theories, and as responsible scientists we're trying to disprove our theories. We are not supposed to be\ntrying to prove our theories. That's one more foot\nout of the science box that archeology often steps. We're supposed to be disproving what we think is\nhappening, not proving it. - Yeah, you don't wanna lean\ninto the mystery too much. I mean, it's such a weird discipline 'cause you're operating in a, it's like really in a dark room, you're feeling around a dark room. So it's mostly mystery, I would say, a lot of sciences operate\nin a mostly well lit room. It's like a dark corner and you're kind of figuring\nout a way to light it. But in, yeah, in archeology, it's, most of it is a mystery, right? - Yes, it's job security,\nI like that part, you know. But I do also try to always remind myself that every paradigm shifting idea that humans have ever had\nbegan as heresy and lunacy. You know, that guy was crazy up to the second he was brilliant. And so we gotta keep our minds open to the things that sound outlandish, because one of them\neventually is gonna lead us to the big paradigm shift. And if we, you know, if we're\nbusy burning books of ideas that we don't like, that's\nwhere we close our minds to the possibility of advancing things. - I really love that, and I really appreciate\nthat you're saying that. One of the fascinating things\nabout just the Amazon to me is that there's still a large\nnumber of uncontacted tribes. To rewind back into ancient\nhistory, you can imagine all of these tribes that existed in the Amazon that were isolated, very sort\nof distinct from each other. Can you speak to this, your\nunderstanding of these tribes and their history that\nare still here today? - Well, a lot of them are these, you know, by uncontacted we mean we don't know anything about these guys. We know roughly where they are, but places like Ecuador have\nvery responsible policies where no one's allowed to go contact them. So we have a dearth of information. If they walk out of the jungle and talk to us, that's one thing. But we don't go out and\nthere looking for 'em. But they do seem, you\nknow, frozen in time. And I don't think any of\nus have a good estimation of how long they've been like that. But, you know, we were saying\nearlier that, you know, humans change based on\npressures of their environment. You know, it's a mother\nnecessity is oftentimes how we invent things or why\nwe change it's pressure. And one thing the Amazon\nis, once you, you know, figure out how not to die in\nit, it's a paradise of food, food's falling from the\nsky all the time there. And if once you learn to\nadapt to that environment, you've got very little need. There's no pressure to make anything else. Things are working. - So for the modern humans that come across these uncontacted tribes, one of the things they document and notice is the propensity\nof these tribes for violence. So they get very aggressive in attacking whoever they come across. - And not just foreigners,\nthey attack each other. The Yanomami are famous for just having never ending feuds with each other. - What do you think of the\nphilosophy behind that? - I don't, you know, I'm a\nrelatively peaceful person, but I've got, you know, I've got the monster in\nme like everybody does. And I think that these, you\nknow, it's cultural norms that become institutionalized. For the Yanomami, they really, part of the rite of passage to be a man is to go kill or maim somebody\nfrom an outer village. And they go in there, they oftentimes, the way they don't let inbreeding set in and ruin everybody, not that they think of it scientifically,\nbut they typically go and steal women from far off communities. And that starts a big fight. Another thing that starts fights when nobody even fought is illness. Illness in the Amazon and all of the ancient\nAmericas wasn't seen as a biological thing,\nit was a spiritual thing. So if somebody in your village gets sick, the question is asked, well,\nwhat spirit is menacing him? And who called it out on him? And then the rumor starts, well, I bet you it was Joe over there in that other community,\nhe's still pissed off for that time when we stole his daughter. And we ought to go over\nthere and kill Joe. And then he'll get better. And so this round of\nnever ending violence, like Hatfield and McCoys had that thing. And the people of New Guinea also do that. So it's not, you know,\nthere are certain areas, mostly wooded areas now\nthat I think about it, where people just hide out and they attack each other\nas a cultural institution. - It's such a tricky thing to do, to study an uncontacted tribe without obviously contacting them to figure out their language,\ntheir philosophy of mind, how they communicate, the\nhierarchy they operate under. - And yeah, you know, there was\na fascinating story in Peru, I guess it was probably like\neight years ago or something, but there was a ranger from\none of the biology stations who just in the by and by\nof protecting his area, met one of these uncontacted tribes and befriended someone,\nnot the whole tribe, but he made some friends who would meet him in the\nwoods, not in their community. And he started to learn their\nlanguage over a couple years. And so he was this kind of important guy who actually could be the first translator to talk to these people. And one day a couple of them\njust came out of the woods and just plugged him with\narrows and just killed him. And then they went back in the woods. Like, that's the one guy who\nunderstands what we're saying, we should kill him and move our village. - So those folks really lean into the, as you said, the monster versus the puppy. - You know, everybody's got it, I think, I think, you know, we need to listen to our better angels because if we don't, we as a human species can easily devolve into\njust using violence and against others to get what we want. It's a daily choice we\nmake not to be savages. - Which is fascinating thing to remember. We kind of think in civilized society, we've moved past all that. But it can be summoned like in\n1984, the two minutes of hate with the right words, that\nprimal thing can be summoned and directed and lead\nto a lot of destruction. - And, you know, our sports are really based\non taking those kinds of urges and channeling them positive, where somebody's not\ndead at the end of it. - Yep. So at which point did what we now call the\nMaya civilization arise? - That's another complicated one. Another group living mostly in a jungle that we have barely begun to explore. You know, the truth is, a lot\nof the questions in the Amazon and what we're talking\nabout now is the Peten and the mountains there. Those aren't places\narcheologists wanna live. They're horrible, I mean, I've been there. I don't wanna live in\na tent and eat rations. I wanna live in a nice town. So a lot of the places\nwhere the answers are, we still really haven't gotten there 'cause it takes a special\nperson to be educated enough to know what they're looking at and tough enough to want to be there. I've done my tour of duty, I'm now in a nice little podcast studio. But seriously, the Maya, the first hint that we see people who are\nculturally Maya very close to where the time period for that Chavin culture is about 1800 BCE. There's a culture that's some\ncalled the Mokaya, not Maya, but they're on the Pacific coast where Guatemala and Mexico connect. It's called the Soconusco. And those are the first people that are really gonna be culturally Maya. And they're interacting with the culture that has traditionally been\nseen as Mexico's mother culture, which is the Olmec. They're kind of the same thing as we were talking about in South America, where the Maya, the original Maya are not, there's not a whole lot to indicate that they have a religion, but the Olmec have this\nreligion they develop and they start exporting it. And you see the Maya become more and more involved in the\nreligion that's being created by the Olmec who are to the north of them in the swamps of what we call\nthe Isthmus of Tehuantepec. - I have a lot of questions to ask here about just the\nnatural stupid confusion I have. So first, did the Maya\nor the Olmec come first and are they distinct groups? Like how do you maintain\na distinct civilization when you're so close together? - I just finished filming\na whole thing on the Olmecs and their interaction with the\nMaya for the great courses. I'm thrilled for it to\ncome out next spring. I think they co-evolved. Archeology in this regard\nis the worst enemy of this. So we put these names on cultures. We talk about how they\nevolve from one to another. We draw these lines\nwhere there aren't any, we make these time periods that a culture magically transforms into\nsomebody with another name, where I'm pretty sure they didn't care about any of those names. But the Maya and the Olmec are two parts of a larger interaction sphere that's happening in\nMesoamerica, very dynamic time. The Olmec are really\nbringing the religion part, but the other areas are\nbringing technology, ceramic technology,\nmaking hematite mirrors, making tools out of obsidian and other stone types. So you've got the Olmec in the middle where Mexico gets skinny and\nit gets swampy down there. That's called the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. That's where the Olmec are. Then you've got the Maya\nto the east of them. Then you have the Valley of Oaxaca where the people call the\nZapotecs, they're rising up. And then you have the Valley of Mexico, which will eventually become the Aztecs, but not for millennia. All those areas are\ninteracting with each other. - Can we just also draw some more lines? - Yeah, sure. - So what is Mesoamerica\nand what is South America and what you just said,\nthe Olmecs and the Maya, like, can we just linger on the geography that we're talking about here in the, what is this, like a thousand BC? - Yeah, the time period\nwe're talking about where the Olmec are there, a thousand BC is a great midpoint of it. I'd say it starts about 1800 BCE. And by 500 BCE the Olmec are gone. And a whole new wave of civilization and population increase happen. In terms of Mesoamerica, looking at your map here,\nI'd say about halfway through the Chihuahua desert\nup there in the top left. That's about the boundary of Mesoamerica. There's this big desert\nwhere almost nobody lives. And once you get north enough, you get into the ancestral pueblo people of what's now America,\nthe Four Corners area. They're not Mesoamerican,\nthey have different lives. - Where does modern Mexico end? - Modern Mexico ends, right, you know, you see the name Maya there with the white line around it. That's Guatemala, so\nGuatemala cuts off most of Mexico from Central America. - Got it. - But Mesoamerica only goes about halfway through Honduras. And then it's really\nkind of a no man's land. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama. They really, they're neither, they're not Mesoamerica,\nthey're not South America. They're more South America 'cause they've got some gold there. But then basically you get\non the other side of Panama and you're fully in South America with two distinct groups too. You've got the guys that are\non the Andes on the West Coast, and then you have the Amazon. - So the West of the Andes and the Amazon are very distinct. So when you refer to the Andean region, is that referring to\nthe Andes and the Amazon or just the Andes? - Just the Andes and the\ncoast to the Pacific there. That's Andean civilization. - So did the Maya make it to\nthe Andes, the Andean region? - Not that archeology can prove, but it's almost certain that they interacted with each other. Number one, it's just, you\nknow, it's biased to think that these people\ncouldn't travel as widely as people on the other\nside of the planet did. But there's all sorts of hints. Like that first ceramics\nI was talking about that the Maya made,\nthey show up strangely, sophisticated technologically already and down in Ecuador, they had them for a thousand years before. So a lot of people, myself\nincluded, think that the idea of ceramics actually came from\nSouth America to the Maya. - Did the Maya get\nseeded by the second wave across the Bering Strait or did that initial\nwave of people that came and populated South America, were they the ancestors of the Maya? Like how did the migration happen here? Do we understand that? - We're still piecing it together. I don't think, you know, I'd\nbe lying if I told you I had the answers, but we do have\nevidence of Maya stature people, they are small people, generally speaking, people that grow up in\nthe forest are smaller and people that grow up in\nthe open plains are taller. Probably about, you know,\njust generations of people that hit their head on a\nbranch or not. (laughs) - Joking, but, you know, there\ncould be something to that. - I think there's some truth to it, I mean, the Pygmies are small and the people on the\nplains in Africa are big. The North American Indians are\ntall and the Maya are small. There's definitely a\npattern of smaller people in the forests. But anyway, there's a cave in the Yucatan called Loltun Cave that has hand prints in the cave. It's somebody who put\ntheir hand on the cave and spit charcoal around their hand, like a negative print. We can date that charcoal. And it comes from 10,000 years ago. And the hands are all small. It's, you know, typical Old Mexico. I walked right up to these\nthings and could put my hand. I didn't, you know, mess with them, but I put my hand next to these hands and they're all smaller than my, you know, Northern European hand. And so either it was a bunch of kids who were in this cave 10,000 years ago, or it was people of\nMaya stature who did it. - It's so cool that you\ncan date the charcoal. And it's so cool that 10,000 years ago there were people living. - And actually we have one that's, I think 2000 years older now, just a couple years ago,\nagain in Yucatan, in a cave. They found a woman they named Naia now, and she's like 12,000 years old. - So the best guess maybe that you have is it goes across the Bering\nStrait to South America, possibly the Amazon, develop a lot of cool ideas in the Amazon and start drifting back\nup into Mesoamerica. - Was kind of a co-evolution. The technology of ceramics, I think got there through\nan interaction with it. - See, the interesting thing is that the Maya didn't really have religion, didn't have as a vibrant\nreligious set of ideas, and they borrowed it from the Olmec. - I've been doing a deep dive on this for this Olmec course that I just did. And it really does seem\nlike these other cultures that have jade and hematite and obsidian, the Olmec had none of that stuff. They were living in a swamp and\nbuilding things out of dirt, but they were importing those\nmaterials from those areas, carving them into all sorts\nof religious iconography and then exporting them back to them. - And still the fanged\ndeity show up there? - No, the fanged deity's\nnowhere in Central America and Mesoamerica. There's jaguars, there's\njaguar iconography, but it's not the same thing. This whole Jaguar transformer\ndeity does not exist there. They do have a pantheon. - So the Maya, the Olmec and the interesting\npeoples of the regions. What was their, I'd love to ask questions about who were they? So one question I'm curious about, what was their sense when\nthey looked up at the stars? What was their conception of the cosmos? - That's a question I've spent my entire career trying to answer. I think that they saw it as proof of the cyclical nature of life. And certainly they saw, like every ancient group did,\nlike, are those the gods? Why are those things so far away? But I think that the Maya\nespecially looked at it with a much more mathematical\nmind than most did. And so they watched these\nthings move every night. And if you do that, even today, you notice that all the\nstars move in tandem. They're just this blanket, they're like, they're like this curtain behind me. They're the stage upon which some very important players are dancing, and that's the moon, the\nsun, and the planets. There's five planets we can see visibly. So they started watching\nlike, why are just those seven moving differently than the rest? And those are the things that\nthey keyed on mathematically. The sun, of course was also involved in the agricultural cycle. So that was important in and of itself. But the planets, we can see\nthem coming up with ideas, definitely doing the math and seeing that there is a repeated cycle. And then coming up with\nmythology around them, like Venus for them was\nassociated with war. And they had very ritualized\ntimes to go to war. That had something to do with Venus. Sometimes in the classic period Maya, it was the first appearance\nof Venus as the morning star. That was a good time to go to battle with your neighbors. And when it became the post-classic with like Chichen Itza being\nthe capital of the Yucatan, then it looks like if you\nwatch Venus day after day, it goes slowly up every day. And then when it hits its highest point as morningstar in the morning, it goes down to the Earth\nlike three times as fast. All of a sudden it just shoots\ndown and hits the Earth. And so the people of\npost-classic Maya civilization saw that as the gods shooting\na spear into the Earth. And that was a good time\nto attack your neighbors. That was like wartime when the\nspear is gonna hit the Earth. - Right, so this is fascinating. They just had at the foundation a sense that life existence at the\nvarious timescales is cyclical. That's the starting point. And then you just look out there and if you are extremely\nprecise, which is fascinating, how precise they were, you\ncan just measure the cycles. - Yeah, and they did it really well. Now of course, they are the only ones to develop a fully\nelaborated writing system in all of the Americas. The South America had the Quipu, but it's so different than our writing. We're still trying to figure\nout what the heck it is. We know there's math there too, but they had the ability\nto take a lifetime worth of measurements and hand\nit to the next generation who would then do it more and do it more. That's how they figured out kind of the holy grail\nof ancient astronomy. How good were they was whether they could see the\nprocession of the equinoxes, the fact that we're just barely wobbling. And there's a 26,000 year\nperiod where the stars as that backdrop will spin all\nthe way around and come back. It's 26,000 years. But the Maya were able\nto figure out, wait, it's moving one degree every 72 years, and did a calculation based on where it should be in the ancient past. And they're using constellations. They're showing us they\nknow by saying like, this planet's in this\nconstellation right now and 33,000 years ago it would be in this constellation. - It's just fascinating that they were able to figure this out. I would love to sort of\nunderstand the details of the scientific community,\nif you can call it that. - I think we absolutely could. And that's actually one of\nthe things that I'm hoping to move the needle on in my\ngeneration with my career, is to give these cultures\nthe respect they deserve as standing toe to toe with the rest of our ancient civilizations we respect, there are things that\nshould be called science that are not being called\nscience at the moment. You know, their math is incredible. Their hydraulic engineering is incredible. Their chemistry is incredible. And so I hope to talk about\nthese things differently as a way to get people to recognize the achievements\nin a different way. - Yeah, I mean, unquestionably\nincredible scientific work in the astronomy sense, especially here. Can you speak to all the\nsophisticated aspects of the Mayan calendar\nthat they've developed? - I don't know, you\ngot another five hours. - [Lex] Let's go. - No, I'm kidding. - I should say that you also gave me the 2024 Mayan calendar. - Yeah, I do this just to,\nyou know, show the world that that calendar system is evergreen. It can go into the future or the past for billions of\nyears in the system they made, just like our system is. - So can you speak to\nthe three components here as I'm reading that Tzolk'in,\nthe Haab and the Long Count. What are these fascinating\ncomponents of the calendar? - It's neat how obsessed, they were really math nerds. It wasn't good enough for them to just make one cycle to describe time. They had all these cycles that interlocked into each other. Like cogs in a machine, though they never thought of it like that. But the Tzolk'in's their oldest one and the one that still endures\ntoday, there are millions of Maya people that are living their lives based on a 260 day count. No weeks, no months. It's just 13 numbers\ncombined with 20 day names for a total of 260 days. And then it goes again. Everybody in the highlands knows what their birthday is in that calendar, knows what it means\nabout their personality and the kind of jobs that\nthey're supposed to do. Each one of those days\nhas their own spirit. And what's supposed to\nhappen in those days, the Maya collectively call them the mom, the grandmother, grandfather spirits. And they talk to each one of those days and they pray to them. There's now an association\nof some 8,000 people that are called Aki that are day keepers who are keeping the days. And they're also like\ncommunity psychologists almost. People come to them and say,\nyou know, my life is mixed up. What's wrong here? Well, let's ask the mom, like, okay, well it looks like you're\nnot doing this or that. Or you know what, you're an accountant. You're not supposed to be an accountant. You're supposed to be\na, you know, a midwife. What are you doing? You're living your life wrong. You're a kib. You need to start being a kib person. - So they take extremely seriously the day on which you're born. What that means, like the\nspirit that embodies that day. - Right, like I'm kib, I'm 13 kib and it says my, it's funny how\naccurate a lot of them are. Mine is basically is, I'm an irresponsible husband and parent, but people like me, so\nmy family still prospers. Like, well God, that's horribly accurate. - I mean some of it is\nalso the chicken or the egg if you truly believe, so, if you structure society where this calendar is truly sacred, then it kind of like you manifest a lot, the spirit does manifest itself\nin the life of the people that is born on that spirit's day. - Absolutely.\n- It's interesting. - And the Maya really\nfeel this in this system. So that's the core system. This 260 day calendar was\nthe very first calendar they made thousands of years ago. And it's the one that's\nmost important today. - Why 260 days, by the way? Is there a reasoning behind it? - Most Maya agree with this today and you know, who knows what the original architects thousands of years ago were thinking. But it's nine months. It's the human gestation period. So if you conceived on the day 13 monkey, chances are your kids coming\nout on or near 13 monkey. And I think it's beautiful. I mean, if that's right,\nthat means the Maya and the people of Mesoamerica\nwill all share it together. When they thought about we need a count of time, that's for us. They didn't look up into the heavens, they looked like into their bodies. What's the first cycle that we\nactually go through as humans and they pick this nine month thing. It really is our cycle. And no other culture on the\nplanet looked inside themselves to create their calendar like that. - So that's the oldest one and the sacred one that still\ncarries through to today. What's the second one, the Haab? - The Haab is the solar\ncalendar, the one that everybody on the planet eventually comes up with. We know it's second though because when they start talking about it, they use all the symbols and\nthe numbers from the 260 one. They say, well we need a solar one too. Let's just keep counting\nthis another 105 days and we'll get to 365. - Oh, interesting, they\nkind of carry the same. Got it, got it, got it, got it. And that's useful because for\nall the sort of agricultural, all this kind of reasons. - Right, though interestingly, they never put a leap year in, the Haab is also called the vague year 'cause it's just 365, which means every year they're off a quarter of a day and eventually it starts really adding up. In fact, it's even caused modern problems. In this calendar here, I just do the straight math\nfrom a thousand years ago. And so I place the beginning\nof the solar year differently than some Maya groups\ndo, especially the guys in the highlands of Eastern Guatemala. They write me nasty emails saying, I don't know what time the year is, but their relatives\nchanged it in the 1950s because their agricultural\ncycle was so far off. They moved it 60 days back to\nmake it in the spring again. But it drifts, which is strange 'cause it's not a very good thing for the agricultural cycle. It's one of these mysteries we still don't have an explanation for. - So that's the Haab, and\nthen what's the Long Count? - The Long Count's the\nreally mysterious cool one because it's a linear count of days, which are not like them. It's a bunch of cycles\nlike ours, you know, our weeks are a cycle,\nour months are a cycle. But it's weird in that\nits estimation of the year in the long count system is only 360 days. So it's miserably off a solar year. They count in base 20. So they count, like we\ncount in tens we're decimal, they count in base 20, vigesimal. And so it should be,\nyou know, there's ones, there's twenties, there's four hundreds, there's eight thousands,\nthere's 160 thousands. It's up, it goes just like our tens, hundreds, thousands, 10 thousands. But it's times 20. So that third, so they have\ndays, months of 20 days. And then they have these years that are, should be by their math\n400, but it's only 360. And that throws the whole thing outta whack going further up. Then they have a 20 year period and a 400 year period, 400\nyears to their calendar. But it's only by that\ntime it's only 396 years in our period, in our reckoning. So it's mysterious that\nit's, why did they tweak it at the year to be only 360 days? That's, you know, that\ndoesn't follow any astronomy. That's not the human cycle. - Yeah, but they're, I\nmean, it's interesting that they build up towards thinking about very long periods of time. Like baktun is 144,000 days. - Right, or a baktun is 400\nof the long counts years. So it's kind of like our\nmillennium, you know, we think it's a big deal\nwhen we hit a millennium or a century. They have a 20 year\nperiod that they do a lot of celebrations on called a katun. And then they have the 400\nbaktun, which is the big one that's like their millennium. And 13 of those baktuns occurred\nin the creation before us. They also think that we are in, that the world has had multiple creations. They're not alone in that. There's lots of ancient\ncivilizations who say that, but we're technically\nin the fourth creation. And they have a creation\nstory called the Popol Vuh. And the Popol Vuh is clear as day that the third creation ends with the help of these heroes called the hero twins. And the fourth creation begins. And so on the Maya monuments, we see them doing the math\nthrough the long count and we can calculate it back very exactly. It happened. The fourth creation started\non August 11th, 3114 BC and it says, it doesn't say it's day one, it says it's the last\nday of the 13th baktun of the third creation, which leads us to believe that a creation\nis only 13 baktuns long. - Right, so, and this would be the fourth creation, the calendar. - The fourth creation. But if you do the math going from 3,114 BC and count 13 baktuns\nforward, you get to 2012. - And hence the very\npopular notion that 2012, whenever that was December,\nsomething like that. - December 21st, 2012. - Will be the end of the world. So can you explain this about? - Those were very fruitful years for me. I had so many lectures\naround the country that was, it's like Garrett Morrison\nSaturday Night Live. The apocalypse was very, very good to me. - I mean, but that is pretty interesting. So technically it would be in\nthe what, in the fifth now? - Yeah, technically we'd be in the fifth. Though, my argument was\nthat actually, if you look through all the corpus of Maya mathematics and calendars, they never\nsay anything like that. In fact, there's a handful\nof dates that tell us that the fourth creation\ndoes continue farther on. That that baktun place\nshould have 20 baktuns in it. Like their counting system\nwould dictate, not 13. And there's a place in Palenque, there's a place in the Dresden Codex and one other place I'm forgetting that all talk about time after 2012. So how does that happen, it's a conflict. - Is there supposed to\nbe an overlap of the 13? So it's like 13 is the core\nof it, and it's 20 long. - They love the number 13,\nit's all over the place. It's a magic number to them. My explanation, which I\nadmit is not very solid. But I think that the magical deeds of the hero twins in their\ncreation story at the end of the third creation hit\nthe magical reset button. And that it just\nrestarted time right there because of their magic. But that was not to say that the natural baktun\ncycle should be 13. And there are certain texts that go way forward in time\nor way backward in time. And whenever they wanna do that, there are higher increments\nthan just the baktun. Above that, there's the piktun, then there's the kalabatun,\nthen there's alawatun and it goes on and on. And these are like, you\nknow, 160,000 years, huge increments of time,\nwhenever they wanna do that, and they talk about a long period of time, they start putting thirteens\nin all of those increments, those higher increments. And I think what they're saying is they're making an esoteric statement about the never ending nature of time. That's what I think they're telling us in those texts that time\ngoes on forever, magically. - But they still had a conception that it didn't go on forever before. That there was other\ncivilizations that came before and this is the fourth creation. - This is the fourth creation. And the gods made everybody, the first ones were made\nof mud and they melted. The second ones were made of sticks, but they were jerks to the animals. The third ones were like us, but flawed in some other way. And then we are finally made of the blood of the gods and corn,\nwe're made out of corn. So we're perfect. And as it explains to\nus, the Popol Vuh does, we got it right this time. There's no reason to believe that this creation has a set duration. One of the weird things\nis that the Aztecs, who we talked to a lot at contact, they also had the concept of\nmultiple creations before us. But they were real clear to the Spanish that they weren't all\nthe same time element. Some of them were in the\nthree hundreds of years. Some of them were in the\nseven hundreds of years, but they were not the same time period. So our mathematical logic that if the third creation was 13, this one must be third\ncreation or also be 13. It's in direct opposition to what the Aztecs told us\nabout the nature of creations. They're different time periods. - Why do you think there was the myth of the previous creations? Did they have some kind of long multi-generational\nmemory of prior civilizations? - It may have had some\necho in the flood myths. - It's the same kind of major myths carried\nthrough long periods of time. - There's a lot of\ndifferent opinions about it. And you know, like if they were all 13, if we have five creations,\nlike the Aztec said, and they were all 13, they would come up to roughly 25,000 something years, which is very close to\nthat processional cycle. So some people are like,\nthey designed it all to be one completion of the\nprocession of the equinoxes. - And I mean that. - I don't believe that one, but that one sure sounds good, doesn't it? That's gonna get a lot of internet hits. - And one of the things\nI do obviously wonder about is why the flood myth is part of like most societies and most religions? - I think that one's pretty easy. It's the end of the ice age\nwhen the bathtub filled back up. - So it's just the ice age bathtub refill. - It's the seas filling back up. - And without really\nunderstanding what happened, they just carried that story? - Everybody knows that everybody's nice coastal\nvillage went underwater. And they had to seek higher ground. - And then just like people\nlike talking about the weather, everybody was talking about the\nweather for many generations as the sea level was going up. And then that myth carried? - Why do we live here, grandpa? Well, we used to live over\nthere, but then the water came. - And then many grandpas later is just kind of permeates every idea. - It becomes mythology,\nbut global mythology. So that one, you know, there's a lot of things I don't have a\nreasonable explanation for, but the flood myth is almost certainly the rise in sea level. - So this idea that every day represents, that carries a spirit. You know, there's modern\nday astrology, you know, most people kind of\nconsider astrology this maybe a bit unscientific woowoo type of set of beliefs. But do you think there's some\nwisdom that astrology carries from your scholarship\nof the Maya calendar? Do you think if we carry that to the astrological\nperspective on the world, do you think there's some wisdom there? - I don't know, you know, I have a woowoo part of me. I would like to believe that stuff, but I don't think as a scientist it makes, I cannot come up with a biological scientific reason why that would be true. And you know, when you\nlook at it objectively, I mean really is everybody\nborn with the sign Scorpio, a moody person? That's just objectively not true. But it is funny how oftentimes\nthese Maya horoscopes, for lack of a better\nword, do hit the mark. There was some student who\nsurveyed like 300 people with the app I made and asked\nthem about their Greek sign and their Maya sign and his conclusion for his term paper was that the Maya one was working way better. Which that's fascinating. At least that's fun. But no, I think I'm\ntoo much of a scientist to believe that, I just don't have any foundation in science\nthat would allow us to believe that the month in which we were born in a cycle sets our\npersonality and destiny. - I agree, and yet there's so much mystery all around us that what I do like is the inbuilt humility to that worldview. That there's this whole, you\ncan call it a spiritual world, but a world that we\ndon't quite understand. And then you can wander\nabout what is the wisdom that that world carries. And then you can construct\nall kinds of systems to try to interpret that. And then there is where the\nhuman hubris can come in and, you know, but it's good to be humbled by how\nlittle we know, I suppose. - I do love the mysteries of the world and I would love to find\nan ancient civilization, but I don't want to solve\nthe mysteries of the world. I think they're one of the things that make life worth living. - That's true, that's true. You mentioned the Maya writing system. What are some interesting\naspects of their language that they've used and the\nwritten language that they used? - Well, you know, one of\nthe things that confound me as a guy who spent, you\nknow, better portion of my life studying it, I had\nthe honor of being the student of Linda Schele right here at the University of Texas at Austin. She got the group together\nwho broke the Maya code of hieroglyphics in the 1970s. So I learned from the best. And loved every minute\nof it, I miss Linda. - Can you speak to that code actually, the hieroglyphic code and\nwhat it takes to break it? - Oh boy, I mean, what a thing. We had kind of a Rosetta Stone. We had a page out of\nDiego de Landa's book, a priest who was converting\nthe Maya in Yucatan asked his informants about their writing system and what every sound meant. And he was convinced they\nhad a alphabet like we do. So he got this Maya\nguy sat down in Spanish and he said, okay, you're gonna write all the\nsymbols right here in my book. Write an A here, write a\nB here, write a C here. And that guy just wrote all of the sounds that the priest told him to write. They were actually syllables, they were vowel consonant combinations. They weren't an alphabet. But that turned into our\nRosetta stone of sorts. The big key is that the Maya\nstill speak that same language. There are millions of Maya people who are speaking a version of Maya. Now, there's where I get confused that we've got a single writing\nsystem that is intelligible. We've broken the code. So we know that it's basically\nthe same writing system from the top of the Yucatan\ninto Guatemala and El Salvador. But we have 33 Mayan languages today that are mutually unintelligible. And we backwards project the language of what they spoke back then. That the glyphs are in to\nsomething called Cholti which is a combination of Chorti and Chol, two of those languages. But it doesn't work for me at all. How did, if there was one\nlanguage, maybe two back then, how did it flower into 33\nmutually unintelligible languages in just 500 years during acculturation and horrible infectious diseases that killed 90% of the population? How did that happen? So we're missing something huge here. I think it's more like\nChinese, where Chinese letters, writing can be read in multiple languages and still understood. I don't know exactly the mechanics\nof how that would happen, but it just seems impossible\nthat there are more languages, not less languages in the Maya area after the last 500 years\nthat they've been through. - So you think that there's\nsome kind of process of either rapidly generating dialects or there always has been these dialects, or I should say they're\ndistinct languages, even though there was a\ncommon writing system? - There must have been a\nway that multiple languages understood the same writing system. Or maybe there was something\nlike Latin, you know, how there was a period in Europe where like most people were illiterate and there was this priesthood\nwho all understood Latin and they wrote in Latin. Maybe the hieroglyphs represent a kind of Latin in the ancient Maya world. - But we don't really know. And there's not clear\nevidence to fill in the gaps of how it's possible to have that. - Right, but we did\nrealize it was actually a Russian scholar named Yuri\nKnorozov who broke the code. The Americans and the\nEuropeans were absolutely sure that the language was, that the written language\nwas a dead language. But Yuri not knowing any\nof that, not being filled with all of those thoughts\nfrom America, and Europe went about it in the\nway that he was taught in his grad school in Moscow. And just went to the dictionaries and he looked at Yucatec language that they're speaking today and he applied it to the symbol system and he knew that there\nwere certain sounds. He used Lambda's alphabet. And he found there was,\nhis two key examples were a picture of a dog with a symbol over it and a picture of a turkey\nwith a symbol over it. And the dog, a dog in Yucatec is \"zool.\" So he saw two symbols and he said, this one's probably \"zool\"\nand this one's \"ul\". And then the Turkey was \"kuuts,\" so it would be \"kuu\" ending in \"tsu\". And he showed how, look,\nyou know, this is \"tsu,\" this is \"zool,\" those two things that should\nbe \"ts\" are the same symbol. And that began this process\nof unraveling the syllables that we're still working on today. - That's fascinating. Just that decoding process is fascinating. Like how do you even figure that out? And there's probably still,\nis there still, are you aware of any written languages that\nhaven't been decoded yet? - Yeah, yeah, there's a number of them. There's Easter Island Script,\nI was just talking to. We've apparently made\na few advances there. Now it's called Rongorongo. And we only have about\nmaybe 25 examples of texts, but we're beginning to break that. There's also the big one is Harappan. Harappan for a long time we used to say there were five independent\nscripts on the planet and those were Chinese, Cuneiform, which is Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Maya, and then Harappan, which\nis from Northern India. That's the only one that\nwe've never cracked. And now all the epigraphers,\nthe people, that's the term for epigraphy is\ntranslating these languages. They're all ganging up on Harappan and want to kick it off the\nlist 'cause we can't break it. It had a big enough symbol set, but no one's been able to crack it. And now they're saying it's\njust an elaborate symbol set and doesn't reflect the spoken word. - That's a hypothesis, which is what would explain\nwhy it's so difficult. - Right, but you know,\nwe could just be faced with the quitter generation. Maybe somebody will pick up\nthe baton next generation. - Kids these days with their. - The other one that fascinates\nme is from the Americas. It's the Quipu, the Inca had the Quipu. This nodded string records, but it was definitely\nencoding more than just math. We know the math. I know lots, I can do the math Quipus and figure out what they're\ntotaling and things. Yeah, there's a Quipu right there. - Quipu are recording devices\nfashioned from strings, historically used by a number\nof cultures in the region of Indian and South America,\na Quipu who usually consists of cotton or camelid fiber strings. So there's a set of strings and they're supposed to\nwhat, to be saying something? - There's one long string that the little ones dangle off of. And each one of the\ndangling strings have sets of knots on them. And the knots, some of them\nare mathematical Quipus and those, we can just do the math, we can prove that it's math. They also encoded language in there. They had entire libraries in Cusco where Spanish conquistadors\nwere brought through. And the caretakers of the\nlibraries would just put, they'd say, pull that one\ndown, read that one to me. And he'd pull it out and just\nread a history of something that happened 200 years earlier. So it was definitely writing. But in the 1570s, one head of the church\nthere had all of the people that could read them called quipucamayocs, gathered up, had them\nread all of their Quipus and transcribe them into Spanish books, and then had the Quipus burned\nand those people murdered. - Okay, well there you go. - And so we can't break\nthe code still today, but we know it was\nabsolutely a written language though it wasn't written,\nit was weaved or knotted. - And there's still some\nQuipus available that could be. - There's, I think now we've\njust crossed the 1000 mark. So we have a thousand Quipus, there's enough to break the code. And I think this generation might be the one that does it. - It's sad that so few have survived. I mean a thousand is good, but it's. - But see, there's, Peru\nhas barely scratched the surface with archeology. There's so much out there. There was a priest I read\nabout named Diego De Porres, who was one of the early people in Peru converting communities. And his chronicle is\nreal clear that he wanted to teach this community of 3000 people, all the Spanish prayers,\nthe important ones for them to be converted\ninto Christianity. And he had the communities'\nquipucamayocs knot Quipus for each person that told them that they could read them\nout and memorize the prayers. And if they were caught\nwithout their Quipu in town, they were flogged. So he had 3000 of the same Quipu made and handed out to this community. If we find that community and find its cemetery,\nthere is a Rosetta Stone. - You know, it is probably\nthe case there is somebody in Peru and maybe a large community that knows this language\nthat understands, and like, you just have to show up and ask them. And it's like, they're like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - There are some communities\nthat are using them. There's a couple of them\nthat we had high hopes for. And then it was apparent that they were just making shit up. They didn't actually know how to read it. They just knew it used to be read. So they like made a bunch\nof stuff about what it says. And they bring it out and they\nact like they can read it, but then when you ask 'em\nthe details, they don't know. But then on a much simpler level, there's llama herders who\nkeep a string in their pocket and they've got the knots equaling how many llamas they have. And then they have subcategories\nof information like, this one's sick, we've lost\nthese ones, this one's pregnant. So they have these more simple\nand more mathematical Quipus but they're using them\nto affect as a record. - Is it possible through\narcheology to know what, you know, the social organization of the Maya was? Like, what maybe if there was a hierarchy, maybe what the political structure was, if there was a leader, different\nroles, you know, priests or like who had the\npower, who was powerless, who had certain kinds of roles,\nis it possible to know that? - Actually because of hieroglyphs, yeah, we know a whole lot. There's, you know, basic\nthings that archeology, which is a very blunt\ntool, can figure out like, this guy lives in a rich house, this guy lives in a poor house. But the hieroglyphs tell us specific stuff about who can rule,\nthat it was hereditary. That that hereditary rule was based on royal blood that could be burned and connect to the ancestors that lived up in the sky versus the one that's lived in the underworld. It also told us things\nabout hierarchy like that there were councils of\nlords underneath the king who each represented clans, who\nhad their own neighborhoods, and that there were revolving\npositions of authority. There was the site that I\nmapped for my dissertation and spent years in the\njungle there, Palenque, had lord's title named Fire\nLord, that was one of the, like, generals of their army. And we could tell that\nposition changed over time. So there was one guy named Chak\nSuutz, who was the Fire Lord for the early part of a reign of a king called the Ahkal Mo' Naab. And then by the time he\ncarves this other panel, there's another guy in the\nposition of yajawk' ahk', which was the fire Lord. And so he had.\n- Got promoted? - Well he could have been killed. I mean, in the case of that, but then we have the interesting case of, in the post-classic, they\nshed the idea of kings. They don't like kings anymore. That's probably a big part of\nwhy the classic disappearance and the abandonment of\nall those cities happened. People just got sick of kings. And so they turned into\nthis more council system at Chichen Itza. But then when Chichen Itza\nfalls, there's a new city, that's architecture looks\na lot like Chichen Itza. It's called Mayapan, but it has what it's called\nthe League of Mayapan. And it has a council of representatives from the communities from all around the Yucatan. And it is basically a democracy. It is a Maya democracy that happens. The individuals from all\naround the Yucatan are there. Each family has their own\ncouncil house at Mayapan though they live back at their place. It's kind of like a Maya Congress. - They have representative democracy. - it really was, I mean, and this happens in I guess 1250 AD that this Maya democracy happens and we know the names of\nthem, we know the families, and of course they were humans. So eventually they screwed it all up. One family murdered another family and the whole city burned. - Yeah, and of course it's probably some fascinating corruption, which is hard to discover through. - Part of it was the\nAztec screwing things up. The Aztecs came down\nwith all sorts of like, we'll buy everything you're making. And then eventually they were like, could we maybe buy some humans? And then one family was like, no. And the other family\nwas like, I don't know, they're making us a lot of money. So then, you know, they\nmurdered each other and the water supply got polluted\nand then the city burned. - It seems like slavery, murder and disease is a large component\nof the story of humans. As you mentioned, different\nperiods in the Maya, the classic, the post-classic,\nthe pre-classic, the archaic, can you just speak to that? So archaic is before there was really a civilization that was. - Archaic is pretty much when\neverybody's hunter-gatherers. - So the classic period\nwas the golden age. And then the pre-classic\nis the interesting time that we were talking about and the post-classic is when\nthe democracy came about. - Well, midway through it. Reverted back to council systems. The Maya loved to be part of councils. So yeah, we have, pre-classic is like the\norigins of civilization. They're starting to build cities. They're starting to create their calendar. They're starting to create\nthese wonderful works of art. And the classic period, if you look at 10 different textbooks for the Maya, you'll get 10 different dates\nthat wiggle around in there. But basically that's\nthe age of kings, to me, that's when these cities decide that they're gonna organize themselves around elite royal families\nthat have this magical blood that can contact their ancestors that are directly in\ncontact with the gods. The Maya never contact\ntheir gods directly. They contact their\nancestors who are up there, who act like liaisons to the gods. And so the Maya age of kings has these dynasties sprouting up where these people have, you know, basically snowed the rest of the people, that they've got a special\nquality of their blood and only their offspring\ncan do the same trick and talk to the gods where everybody, every Joe Maya can let their blood and burn it and contact their ancestor but Joe Maya's dad is just a corn farmer who lives down below, and he's got no influence over the gods. But the rulers, their\nspirits go down briefly, but then they go up into the heavens and reside where the gods\nare and can act as liaisons. So that's the validation for this kingship that happens for about 400 years. I know we say 250 to 900, which is kind of the\nencompassing edges of it. But it's interesting that\nit's actually specifically the ninth baktun of their history. The ninth baktun begins in like 426, and it ends in like 829. So it's a 400 year period of time. And before that, there were no kings. And after that, there really aren't kings. They're heads of councils. So I call it the age of kings, where everybody's following the directives of basically a despot and\nfor a while that's great. I mean, cities build up,\npopulations happening. I see it as kind of a cult\nof personality moment too, strong, charismatic leaders inspire people to do great things together, but eventually, like happens\nall the time with power, too much power corrupts, all of a sudden there's this\nunwieldy huge elite class that has to be treated\nspecial by everybody else. And they start saying, well,\nI think we should fight with those guys, and\nyou guys should go cut, take these things. And people eventually get sick of it, and they walk away from these cities. And that's how we get the\nmysterious Maya collapse where all these cities are just gone. - That's one of the great mysteries of the Maya civilization is\nthat over a very short period of time, like a hundred years, it seems to have declined very rapidly. It collapsed, what do\nyou think explains that? What happened? - I think it's a failing of archeology to properly see what was happening. I think that most of those\ncities, populations, moved, you know, no more than\n20 to 40 kilometers out and started their own farm, and they lived in perishable houses. And all archeology signature sees is that nobody lives in\nthe city center anymore. We don't see a bunch of mass bodies. There's no evidence of\npeople getting sick. There are certain cities that fought with each other at the end, and we see that signature plain as day. We know when a city was\nattacked and burned, mostly that didn't happen. People moved and migrated. And it seems like right there around like between 800 and 900, a lot of\nthe elites that were on top in the most of it was in the rainforests of northern Guatemala. They move, they move in two directions. Some of them move into the\nhighlands of Guatemala, and some of them move up into the Yucatan. The city of Chichen Itza becomes the next big capital in Yucatan. But the word Itza is\nactually a word describing the people who lived\naround Lake Peten Itza in northern Guatemala. And all of the Maya are\nsuper clear about that, that the Itza came in as\nimmigrants with these new ideas and created Chichen Itza. So the elites who were no longer welcome\nin their cities just moved and set up shops somewhere else. - So why was there a decline? What was maybe the catalyst? Was there a specific kind\nof events that started this? Was this an idea that kind\nof transformed the society? - We are still debating that. I don't think there is a single reason. I think humans are complicated. I think a lot of things led to this. One thing we can see\narcheologically is that every one of the cities became overpopulated. They were too popular, and we think that they pushed the limits of their capacity to\nfeed and house people. We see it in lots of the cities at the end of the classic period that\npeople are seasonally starving. I remember really stark\nevidence in Copan, Honduras. Copan was this beautiful\ncity, lineage of 17 kings. But the last kings and the last elite burials that\nwe dig from the city center, the teeth are the telling part. They get this thing,\nwhen you're growing up and you're not getting\nenough food seasonally, it shows up in the enamel of your teeth. It's called dental hypoplasia. And if somebody's seasonally starving, it gets these lines in their teeth. And that last generation of\nMaya before they left Copan, even the rich people\nare seasonally starving. So there's a problem there for sure. But I also think, it's a weird thing. It was not an empire. It was a group of independent\ncity states like Greece. Some of them were allied,\nsome of them were enemies. There was a huge civil\nwar that settled out about the end of the classic period. So if it was Europe, you know, the victors would've taken over. The losers would've beat it\nand gone wherever they went. But when they abandoned these cities that were independent\nstill, they all left, both the guys that won and\nthe guys that lost the war. So it couldn't be just as simple\nas spoils go to the victor. It's such a wide area. Not everybody was starving like the people in the Copan Valley. So I personally think it\nwas cylindrically timed. It is interesting to note\nthat that ninth period, that ninth 400 year\nperiod ends right then, and I think a lot of people, you know, I can't prove it archeologically, but I think a lot of people\nsaid, we're coming to the end of a great cycle and we need to renew. We need to change what we're doing. When you talk to the Maya\ntoday, like at the end of this 2012 thing, if\nyou actually talk to Maya, say, you know what happens at\nthe end of a big cycle here, they say cycles are a time of renewal and transformation. That it is all of our obligation to change our lives at the end of cycles, that change is coming. We can either be part of it or\nwe can get steamrolled by it. The Aztecs did this neat thing called the New Fire\nCeremony every 52 years, which was the biggest\ntheir calendar would go, they'd burn down perfectly good temples and they'd burn down\ntheir houses sometimes. And they would just, everybody in society would perform this, what they\ncall the new fire ceremony, and they would renew the world. So I think my personal theory is that the Maya decided at\nthe end of the ninth baktun that it was time to renew the world. - I think this theory makes sense because they really\ninternalized the calendar. I mean, that was a really\nbig part of their culture, the sense of the cyclical\nnature of civilization. - That's what I think. I think that they created that calendar to perceive the cycle and to harmonize with it. - You mentioned Aztec, what\nwas the origin of the Aztec? Where did these people come\nfrom, at what time and how? - You know, almost every one of the cultures we're talking about now, we have two different versions of the answer to that question. We have the archeology version, and we have the Aztecs themselves. The Aztecs have this\nwonderful migration story where they say that\nthey came from a place, well to the north called Aztlan, and that they had this\nmigration that went through kind of a hero's journey where they go to this snake mountain place and they encounter the\nbirth of the war god, that they'll worship after this. And how they stepped into the\nvalley of Mexico as the last, the lost brothers of everyone\nin the Valley of Mexico, they said that they all\ncame from the north. Near Aztlan is a place, a cave with seven different\npassages called Chicomoztoc. And that all the people who spoke the language\nnahuatl came from the cave. And most of them went early\nto the Valley of Mexico. And in the Aztecs story, they were just the lost tribe. They were the last brothers to come in. But then they show up late game, and they become mercenaries. They just start working for communities in the valley of Mexico. And this takes place in the 1300s. So about 200 years before Cortez shows up, the Aztecs show up to\nthe Valley of Mexico, and they make themselves this indispensable group of mercenaries. They do the dirty work, all\nthe civilized communities around Lake Texcoco,\nwhich is now Mexico City. It's all dried up, but those\nguys were too civilized to fight with each other,\nbut they could hire the Aztecs to do their dirty stuff. So the Aztecs did that and really changed the\npolitics in the game of the Valley of Mexico. - The dirty stuff, they're the muscle. - Yeah, they'd go in and they'd kill whoever you wanted killed. Now you're the king of this area. So one of these kings\nthat they were working for really liked them and decided, I'm gonna make the Aztecs\npart of our ancestry. I'm gonna give them my daughter to marry the head of the Aztecs. And the Aztecs sacrificed her, and that really pissed that guy off. So he took like his whole army and ran the Aztecs out. For a while, they say they live in this horrible desert\nsection eating lizards, but then one of their\npriests say, we're gonna walk around the lake, and my\nvisions say that where we see an eagle sitting on a cactus\nwith a snake in its mouth is where we will build our capital. And they see that, but it's\nout on an island in the lake. And he said, well, I don't know. That's the place. So they build up an island,\nthey go to that island, and then they just start piling\nup lake muck until they make a whole city there in\nthe middle of the island. They make, or the lake,\nthey make an island city. And all of this occurs\nin about a hundred years. So they show up about 1300. The capital of Tenochtitlan,\nas they called it, is really established. And from there, they quickly\ntake over the entire valley. They make what they call\nthe triple alliance, which is the two other big communities of the lake are now their allies, but they're not really allies. The Aztecs were brutal. They were just, those\nguys agreed to shut up and let the Aztecs run the show. And then the Aztecs spread like\na wildfire all the way down into the Maya area. Everywhere they go, they\nrename everybody's towns and make them pay tribute. - Pretty short last thing, civilization, spread extremely quickly. Famous, what are some defining\nqualities that explain that? - I think they were very much like, they had an attitude, like Attila the Hun. They just had no problem\nripping your skin off. Everybody else had become too\ncomfortable and too civilized. And the Aztecs were just mercenary. They told everybody, you know, we can either rip your heart\nout or you can work for us, and if you work for us,\nyou'll be just fine. They'd go to every town they'd go to. The first thing they do is they'd show up with a bunch of merchants. There was a merchant class\nwho were also military. They were really the people who assessed where they were gonna attack next. They'd go in with a bunch\nof Aztec products and say, we'd like to trade with you. But all the time they were\nassessing their military prowess, what products they had\nthat they could take. And then soon after the\nPochteca were there, would come the military\nwith the reconnaissance. - So the Aztec had a huge warrior class, as you're saying. So can you linger on\ntheir whole relationship with war and violence? - They worshiped a war deity. Their main temple was the Templo Mayor. It had two temples up on top. One was to Tlaloc the rain God, who liked a lot of sacrifice himself. But then the other one\nwas Huitzilopochtli. He was, that translates the\nhummingbird on the left. But he's the war God, I love\nthat he's a hummingbird. Maybe, you know, he's fast and he comes from the\nmagical side or something. But then right next to the temple on either side were the two temples of the warriors. One was the eagle warrior clan, the other one was the jaguar warrior clan. And they were symbolically in competition with each other. Though a unified force, I guess, you know, probably an analogy between\nlike the Navy and the Air Force. You know, they had a\ngood natured competition of who was better, but\nthey were the same force. So those were their symbolic warriors, dressed up in all of their finery. And they would come at\npeople with these two forces. And it was very unlike anything that had happened before in Mesoamerica. Again, I think I could draw a parallel to what happened in Europe. You know, the famous Henry the\nV moment in Agincourt where, you know, his kind of ragtag army wipes out half of France's\naristocracy with the longbow. Like up until that moment, Europe had a very wars for the elite\nclasses kind of attitude. And then after France lost\nhalf their aristocracy, then it was like, maybe we should be\nhiring from the villages. The same sort of thing\nhappened with the Aztec, that there was a, Mesoamerica really didn't\nhave huge standing armies, but the Aztec put this army together and they intimidated people. They didn't actually have to use it a lot. It was used to great effect in the valley of Mexico. And for the rest of Mesoamerica. It was mostly the fear factor. - But there also seemed to be, you know, a celebration of violence. I think you said that beauty and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec, maybe like the Roman Empire. Was it they just had a maybe\na different relationship with what violence, where that stood in the purpose of life, purpose of existence, is that fair to say? - I would hypothesize\nso, I mean, you know, I think it's one of the wonderful things about studying these\nancient cultures, you know, knowing what our human capacity is. And the Aztecs, when\nI said that statement, what I meant by that is they\nwere absolutely comfortable with human sacrifice and, you know, ripping people's hearts out. They had this just, you know, grotesque, violent bent. But in the same way they also absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry and music and dance. The same Aztec king who\nwould order the hearts of a thousand people\nextracted also would stand up at dinner parties to recite his own poetry or the poetry of famous statesmen\nthat had come before him. And they spent money on\nthings like flower gardens. All of the causeways leading to the Aztec capital had\nbeautiful flower gardens. And they had a museum,\nand they had an aquarium and a zoo, and they had an\nopera and they had a ballet. And these things existed together. There was not in the\nAztec mind any conflict between witnessing someone's\nheart getting ripped out, one moment, in the evening\nwe'd go to the ballet. - How does that contrast\nthe relationship with war and violence, with the other civilizations of Mesoamerica and South\nAmerica, maybe the Maya? What was their relationship like with war? - The Maya were certainly influenced by the Aztec at the end. So we get a skewed perspective from the contact period accounts, because the Maya were much more violent and sacrifice oriented in\ntheir post-classic rendition. But in the classic period,\nit was mostly the priests and the king who were doing\nthe sacrificing of themselves, that we know that the Maya\nkings would cut their penises and then bleed that blood onto paper and the paper would burn and become the smoke\nthrough which they'd commune with their ancestors, but\nthey'd actually tie this paper onto their penis, cut it, and then dance. So the blood splattered, but\nit was them cutting themselves. It was different than killing a bunch of other people for it. It was a auto sacrifice, we call it. Still very macabre, but very different than\ndeciding a whole bunch of other people should die. It was a self sacrifice thing. - Can you speak to the\nsacrifice a bit more? Animal sacrifice, human sacrifice. What role did that play in for the Maya, for the Aztec, for the\ndifferent cultures here? Was that religious in nature? - It was absolutely religious in nature. And the Aztecs were of the opinion that the war God demanded\npeople were captured and sacrificed, and it\nhad to be valuable people. There was a lot of, before they\nmade that big standing army, they had just ritual battles\nthat they would have, and they'd take captives. In fact, all around Mesoamerica,\nthey wanted captives so that they could bring them back and sacrifice them for the gods and the Aztecs deciding\nto specifically follow the war god did this more than anybody. They did it so much and so successfully that they didn't have any enemies nearby. So they decided this\none poor sucker group, not that far away, called the Tlaxcallans, that they were never going\nto make peace with them so that they could go close by every year and just have a little symbolic\nwar with the Tlaxcallans and haul 'em back for a sacrifice. Cortez met those guys and he was like, here are\npeople who hate their guts. I'll just use these guys. So, you know, we say, oh, Cortez\ntook over the Aztec world. It was Cortez and 20,000\nsuper pissed off Tlaxcallans. - And they actual sacrifice what, so there would be kind\nof these ritual battles, or is it chopping off people's heads, like is there some interesting\nrituals around the sacrifice? - It's mostly heart\nextractions, sometimes heads, but they bring them up\non top of the temple so everybody can see it. And they had a specific stone where they would bend them over, so their ribcage would come out and they'd use like a\nthick obsidian knife. And they had a really just like\ntried and true way to do it. They'd stab it in a certain place close, and then they'd push down on the sternum as they ripped up on the rib cage. And they just, so they just make a place where they could just rip it right out - With their hand?\n- Yeah, with their hand. But they were really\njust surgical about it. They'd use a thick obsidian\nknife where they could just break the ribs\nright along the sternum and then push the sternum down. Pull up and just. - While the person was alive? - Yep, while the person was alive. And the Aztecs had this idea, like there was a horrible\ndrought that went on that almost ruined the entire valley. And they came to this conclusion that it's because we haven't been\nkilling enough people. We've got to bump this up. And then when they did and they decided, they really took it out on the\nTlaxcallans, it rained again. So it was proof positive that they should just keep doing that. And they ate people as\nwell, they really did. - As part of the sacrifice, or is this? - After the sacrifice,\nthen they would eat them. And this was part of the drought and the famine thing that started, but then it was just\nkind of the thing to do. When Cortez got there,\nthey were still having certain special feasts\nthat involved humans. And it really upset the Spanish that they would be like\ntricked into eating human. Like, hey, you liking dinner? That was a human. - So the idea, was it actually, having a taste for human flesh or is it just, you know,\nthese kinds of ideas of like, if you eat a person's heart that you can get their\nspirit and their strength. - In the case of the Aztecs, it seemed like they just liked it. This guy, Sahagun, who was a\nvery responsible chronicler that was pretty specific. That like, there was a distribution thing. Like the elites got butts. The butts were the best part. So the butt cheeks, those\nare the best parts to eat. And then like, it went down the chain until some people just\ngot like fingers and toes. - Literally about taste for the Aztec. Boy, all right, well. - They really did, they really did. In fact, that's what caused the, have you heard of the Noche\nTriste, the sad night, The night that the Aztecs really go nuts on the Spanish and kicked them out. It's all triggered by this one guy, Pedro de Alvarado, who's\nleft in charge by Cortez. As Cortez, goes to the coast and tries to talk to the New Force, talk him into being\nfor him, which he does. But Pedro Alvarado's left\nback in town in charge, and they're doing another one\nof these huge Aztec buffets and parties to honor them, and it happens. The guy says, you know,\nhey, do you like dinner? Like, oh yeah, it's a nice dinner. Well, it's humans, you're eating humans. See, I told you they were good. And Alvarado just freaks out. And he has the guards close the doors and he murders everyone in the party. Women, children, nobody has weapons. He just murders everyone, and that's what spazzes the Aztecs out to eventually murder Montezuma\nwho was their captive, and then try to murder all of them. And it was all Pedro Alvarado's fault for freaking out about eating humans. - Just a little practical joke. - It was just, they thought\nit was funny, he did not. - That's fascinating, I didn't realize. So I kind of assume that some level of cannibalism would have\nto do with, you know, eating the heart to gain the spirit of the person or something like this. - In certain, like, you know, deer hunting rituals, things for sure. But the Aztecs, no, they\njust liked eating humans. It was part of the fear factor too. I mean, they could walk into a new town and be like, you guys could\neither send us, you know, a number of Quetzal feathers every month, or we could eat you. - So that psychological warfare and actual warfare, it worked. And that's how they spread quickly. - And they were just about to take over the Maya\nwhen the Spanish came and messed everything up. They had the Maya surrounded and they were about to take\nover the whole Yucatan. - So you think without the Spanish there would be this Aztec empire that would last for a very long time? - Mm, I think there would've\nbeen an Aztec empire. I think they would've\nfinished dominating everybody, but they did it through hate. And everybody hated the Aztecs. So it wouldn't have lasted forever. They were not ruling justly. They were ruling by force. And that can only go on so\nlong before revolution happens. The Inca Empire, I think\nthat would've gone on forever 'cause they were really\ncommunity oriented. Once the Inca took over, like no one in the Inca empire starved, they built architecture,\neveryone was safe. It was the society that could have lasted a long time. - What was the origin of the Inca Empire? - Well, it was bloody at\nfirst, like most of them are. But once they started taking over that, what they did is they empire built. Everybody else had just\nraided their neighbors to get the resources, but\neverybody they raided, they turned them into the Inca Empire. And they created this\nincredible Mita system where you took turns working and they created the road\nsystem so they could get groups of workers back and forth. So a town of let's say 5,000 people, the Inca would roll up with an army of a hundred, 200,000 people and say, you know, would you guys like to be part of the empire? Or would you like us to escort you to the edge of the empire? And if your mayor here agrees,\nthen he can have a town, he can have a house in Cusco. But then the very next month,\na big work crew would show up and they'd start building\nagricultural terraces and storage units. And every month with\nthe agricultural excess, they would have big parties\nand everybody would eat. So people lived well in the Inca Empire. It was a rough beginning, but everybody who agreed to be part of it immediately had access to\na whole bunch of resources and security they never had. - So they started in South\nAmerica and Peru and Cusco, Cusco was like the center of it? - Cusco in their language, Quechua it means navel or belly button. And it's up in the mountains. But there's four quarters. They called their empire Tawantinsuyu, the Land of Four Quarters. And the center of those\nfour quarters was Cusco. - It sprung to life,\nwhat, in like 1200 DC? - Yeah, we backwards project what it was. But it was probably mid 1200s when the first Sapa Inca,\nthe first ruler came in, but it was the, I think it's\nthe ninth one is Pachacuti who really started\nbeing an empire builder. - And part of that, I mean,\nwhat really defined the empire, as you said, roads, they\nbuild a massive road network. - Roads, and in the same\nway that the Roman strategy of building roads and infrastructure. And then every place they took over, they'd create certain key\npieces of Roman architecture that kind of made that city Roman. And they'd rename it something,\nthe Inca did the same thing. They had certain signature\nInca architecture that they would build in\nas the administrative part. They'd send the quipucamayoc, the guys who would weave the, or knot\nthe Quipus as accountants. And though they would go through and say what everybody\ndid, okay, you know, you're a good farmer, you're gonna farm. You are a good weaver, you're gonna weave. All the men here are gonna take a turn at being part of the army. And they sent independent\nquipucamayocs too, that every community had like five or six that were not allowed\nto work with each other. And they all had to\nindependently send their Quipus back to Cusco. And if there were\naccounting discrepancies, they were called to Cusco to figure out who was lying about what. - So there's like a super sophisticated record keeping system. - Yeah, and that was the Quipu and the Spanish recorded what they could and then burned them all. - But that's an interesting\ndevelopment for an empire 'cause that allows you to really expand and have some kind of management, some level of control. - Yeah, they couldn't,\nat the end they were at least 10 million people and there was just no way to do that. Without some sort of sophisticated\nrecord keeping system. - If the Inca had to face Aztec, who wins? - Inca. I mean, the Aztecs were psychotic, but the Inca had just reserves for miles. And they had that\nessential hearts and minds. And there was only one thing that everybody got pissed off about when they joined the Inca Empire. For some reason everything\nwas owned communally, except the llamas. The llamas were the king's. And so that was one thing that like some of them would stay in\ntown just to be work llamas. But you know, you don't\nown your llama anymore. And people are really\nattached to their llamas. To this day, they are like family members. So it'd be like everybody walked in and said everybody's\nfamily dog is now mine. Like really upset people\non an emotional level. - Well, the, I mean, so llamas got domesticated at some\npoint, probably early. I mean, I don't even\nknow when, but early on. - We have rock art that\nprogresses to make it seem, like a progression from\npeople depicted hunting them to people depicted standing\nnext to pregnant ones. So it was still in that archaic period at least that they became friends. - Yeah, but if you roll in\nand you own them, that's. - Yeah, that pissed everybody off. For some reason the Inca owned\neverybody's llama instantly. And he would take anything he wanted. A lot of them would just\nget carted away that day, just sent to Cusco. They'd also take their mummies,\nthat was a weird thing. Everybody mourns their dead. But the Inca just like\nceased to accept it. They would just, the\nmummies were still there. Okay, he's dead, but look, he still got clothes, he's at the party. Let's put a beer in front of him. They just like, they just\nkept people as mummies. And so the ancestral\nmummies of every town, part of the being absorbed\ninto the empire was, okay, your most important\nmummies are now gonna have their own beautiful house in Cusco. But they would physically\nbring those mummies to Cusco to make now Cusco the spiritual heart of their belief system. - I mean, I could see how\nthat would piss people off, but it's also a pretty\npowerful way to say, like, the ancestors that you idolize, that you respect are now in the capitol. - They've been elevated,\nwe didn't steal them. We have given them a new place of honor, and you are welcome to come\nvisit them all the time. And they did, they have these festivals where everyone from all corners of the Inca world would come to Cusco. - And which of the\ncivilizations mummified people? - The Incas for sure mummified people. And even did some of that kind of like Egyptian esque taking out of organs and preparing the body. They'd put like straw inside\nthe cavity and mummify them. But the Maya didn't do it at all. The Maya, in fact, on purpose would flood tombs with water so that the skin would float\noff the skeletons faster. And then they'd get back\nin there, it was jungley. So I think the bugs\nprobably had part of it too. But then they would get back\nin there to get the bones. They'd open it back up\nand take the bones out and paint them with red cinnabar. The one that I was in in\nCopan, we had evidence that they had gone in\nthere four different times, and the last couple times\nthey only took the skull out and repainted it and then put it back in\narticulated on the skeleton. But they didn't mummify, they on purpose would like\ngrossly float the bodies. So they could get the skin off faster and get to the bones. - But would they keep the bones? - Yeah, they'd keep the bones\nand they'd pull the bones out occasionally and do rituals to them or commune with them and\nthen put them back in. - So there's a still a deep connection to the ancestors through\nthe physical manifestation of the ancestors then. Whether mummified or bone. - And to this day, like, if you do an excavation\nhere in the United States, Native American people don't like it. They don't like their\ngraves, which is fine enough. I wouldn't want somebody\ndigging up my grandma either. But the Maya, they love it. And every Maya person, if we find a grave, they're like, yeah, look\nat that, bones, cool. Can I touch? They're not spooked about it at all. They think it's exciting. I one time helped out a physical anthropologist in town in Copan to get a osteology collection\ntogether of various animals. So if we got bones from an\nexcavation, we could see what kind of animal it was\nbased on the collection. And this family said, well, our family dog died last year and buried him in the backyard,\nyou could go dig him up. And so we were like, okay,\nyeah, I mean, we do need a dog. We'll go dig up your dog. And they were like, but the\nkids really want to help you. So their kids came out, and\nthis was like their puppy. And it died, you know, less\nthan a year ago when we got to it, that like, one of them\njust like grabbed up a bone and he was like, \"huesitos,\"\nlike little bitty bones, yay. Like what a weird attitude,\nthat's your dead dog there. But they just, they have a different\nrelationship with the dead. - In some sense that's a\nbeautiful attitude, right? - Yeah. - Why pretend like we're not mortal and there's not this is\njust the process of it, and it's kind of, as you say it now, it\nkind of would be cool. - That's what Day of\nthe Dead is all about. And I love Day of the Dead, you know, Halloween's this creepy thing\nwhere they're all monsters, but Day of the Dead is this beautiful time where we remember our ancestors. I convinced my kids after\nthe movie Coco came out. Now we have an altar with all of our great grandparents on the altar. And we talk about who they\nwere and how they lived. And we put things on the altar\nthat mattered in their life. And we remember them on that day. And it turned something that\nwas a weird eat too much candy and wear a monster mask thing\ninto something beautiful where we discuss where we came from. - I have to ask about the giant stones that Inca has been able to somehow move and fit together perfectly. Do you understand? Is it understood how they\nwere able to do that so well? - No. (laughs) You know, the moving of it, I think that we have reasonable theories. You know, there are ways\nto pivot large weights. There's a great guy\nnamed Wally Wallington, a retired contractor here in the US who built Stonehenge in\nhis backyard in Minnesota, single handedly showing how\nyou can move big stones. So you know, I think Wally's already figured out how to move 'em. It's the perfectly fit\nso carefully fit together that you couldn't even put a\ndime in between the stones. That's the one that I think\nstill has people baffled. The common archeological\nwisdom that you'd find out of a textbook is that they\njust kept pecking away at it with hammer stones and setting them and resetting them\nuntil they were perfect. Which has to be bullshit. There is no way that they\njust were that meticulous. I mean, everybody's got a hammer stone. I personally think it's acids. I think they melted them together. And there are weird places\nwhen you really look at closely to these stones, which I've\ndone a number of times. I'm going back next month to Machu Picchu and especially Cusco, I\nwalk around in the alleys where these 500, you know, to a thousand year old\nwalls are still there. And you see, I see\nthings like the crystals in the andesite are\nalmost stitched together along the seams. Like the andesite around it is melted and the crystals haven't. And there are other places where there are weird wipes on the wall. Like it's just melted, like\nsomebody like took a rag and wiped it while it was soft. Lots of talk about soft\nstones turning hard too, I haven't been able to prove it. This is one of these, you know, end of my archeological career chapters. I'm either gonna prove\nmyself wrong or prove it. But I think they used acids. My dad's a chemist and he told me a long time\nago that there's no way, there's no naturally occurring acids. But my current theory, actually, I got the idea initially\nfrom the show Breaking Bad, I don't know if you ever saw that show, but there's a point in\nwhich they're trying to dissolve a body. And they're using hydrofluoric acid and it goes right through the ceiling. That hydrofluoric acid is so fascinating. You know, it won't go through plastic. And you can also bring it in inert parts and then combine it. The Inca made tons of\njewelry out of fluoride. Fluoride is big in the Andes. And they also mined a lot of\nthings for gold and silver. And the byproduct of that\nmining is sulfuric acid. You put sulfuric acid\nand fluoride together and it's hydrofluoric acid and that will burn through\nandesite or anything. And if you learned how to do\nit, you know, judiciously, and then you didn't care\nwhether, you know, servants lost an arm or two, then you\ncould actually use them to fuse these together. And I think they're fused together. I asked the city of Cusco if I could take some core\nsamples and they said, go away, gringo, don't touch our walls. So this actually, this next time I'm gonna go try to talk to the more Quechuan authorities in a place called Ollantaytambo. And maybe I can convince them, but right now they just\nthink I'm a weirdass gringo who wants to put holes in their walls. - That's a fascinating theory. And so how could you get\nto the bottom of that? So getting core samples to see if there's some kind of trace? - Chemists I'm working with say that if there was hydrofluoric\nacid in between these, that a core sample right along a seam, they they can separate\nout the elements in there and detect whether there\nwas actually elements of hydrofluoric acid. I wanted to go straight to burning rocks, but they were like, no, I mean,\nwe already know that's true. I mean, yeah, we can burn some\nrocks, but it would happen. That's just chemistry. We gotta prove that it\nwould happen in the walls. So go get us samples. And that was before COVID and all sorts of, you know how it is, you probably are the same guy where you've got a thousand\nideas and you know, the ones that are fruitful you run with and the other ones you'll get back to. - That would be fascinating if true. And I hope you do show that it's true or false, either one. - I'll try to disprove it. - Disprove it, yeah, I\nwonder if we discount how much amazing stuff of\ncollection of humans can do 'cause it just feels like\nif a large number of humans are just working a\nlittle bit chipping away at stuff at scale, they\ncan do miraculous things. So the question is, how can a large number of humans be motivated to do a thing? Because I just, when we\nthink about like Stonehenge or some very challenging\narchitectural construction, we don't think about a large number of humans working together. - Well, you know, that large\nnumber of humans are motivated to work together by a small\nnumber of administrators who are dynamic and convincing\nin some way or another. One of my favorite quotes is, and I'm probably gonna misquote it here, but I think it's Margaret Mead who said, \"never underestimate the power of small groups working together. And the truth is that\nthose are the only people that have ever changed the world.\" That small dedicated groups of people are what change the world. And they inspire big groups of people to embrace their vision. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we sometimes underestimate\nhow much humans can do across time, across scale. - And we are way less\ncapable than we used to be. I mean, the average human\nhad all sorts of skills that at least I personally\ndo not, you know, I'm wearing a shirt, but I can't make a shirt,\nthat's for somebody else to do. - You've also lectured about, which I really enjoyed about North America and also helped teach me that there was a lot more complex\nsocieties going on here for a long period of time. So maybe can we start at the beginning? Who were the early\nhumans in North America? - Well, we go through that paleoindian and archaic period for thousands of years. You know, as we started\nthis conversation, probably, you know, 30,000 years\nas a conservative now humans first enter the Americas. But the first cultures we\nget here are mound builders around the Mississippi and to the east. And then also a totally\nseparate group in the, what we call the American southwest now, the four corners who will develop into mostly the people\nwe call the Pueblo people who are still there today,\nlike Zuni and Hopi people. So we've got these two clusters. The very first major\ncommunity in North America is in the most unlikely place. It's in northern Louisiana. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but there is a pyramid\nin northern Louisiana, a big one at a site called Poverty Point that is 3,500 years old. So it's the same age as\nthe pyramids in Egypt. And it is a giant thing just poking out of the\nbayous of Louisiana. And people don't believe me\nwhen I say it, but it's there. - The mound builders. What was that society like in comparison to everything else we've been\ntalking about in Mesoamerica? - They evolved over thousands of years. We call 'em mound builders. This is something I, you know, object to. I think we should have a better, the last version of them we\ncall the Mississippians now, but generally speaking, we call all these guys mound builders. But what they built were pyramids. They look like mounds now. And they didn't build them out of stone. That's, you know, that's kind of our just inherent western bias. Something that's built\noutta stone is sophisticated and something that's built\noutta dirt is rudimentary. But in their full living form, they did have cores of dirt. But then they also had kind of clay caps. So they had terraces,\nthey had whole complexes of buildings up on top. There were kings that lived up there. The biggest of the Mississippian cities, it's called Cahokia, and it's\nright outside of St. Louis. And it was huge. It had a population of 20,000 people and pyramids all over the place. A huge palisade wall around it. It was absolutely gigantic,\na thriving metropolis. And we in America have kind\nof a collective amnesia. Like we never hear about\nthese massive civilizations. Cahokia was the big first city, but then it spread from the Mississippi all the way to the Atlantic. There were hundreds and hundreds of these big\ncities that had, you know, five to 10,000 people each. - Were they their own thing or was there some kind of\nthread connecting all of them? - They had a unified religion and culture. They were, again, not an empire. So there were warring city states. There were kind of\nterritories that were owned by big kings. And then the cities around them were kind of the subsidiary lords and kings. And then one kingdom could either ally with a neighbor or have a fight. So they were kind of\ncountries I think for, yeah, we could safely say there\nwere different countries within this patchwork that\nwas Eastern United States. And you know, it's so weird\nthat we don't know this because it was clearly\ndocumented by the Spanish. I'm not talking about just archeology, we find them in archeology now. But Hernando de Soto landed in Florida and went for three years from,\nhe went up into the Carolinas and over down into Alabama and Louisiana. And he's the first one to\nsee the Mississippi up there. But for three years he went\nthrough city after city, after city, unfortunately decimating them, eating all their corn,\ngiving them diseases. But I mean, the\ndocumentation's clearly there. He met collectively, millions of people in a very sophisticated and uniform civilization. - So it was disease and\nstealing of resources. But was there like explicit\nmurdering going on? - Unfortunately, yeah. He was a murderer and a psycho and a liar. He snowed them that he\nwas some kind of deity, actually learned a trick from the Inca he was with Pizarro in his first run and went back to Spain, was\nrich, had a wife, a castle. Then he got bored and he\ndecided to have a reign of terror on Northern\nAmerica for three years. But he had people burned at the stake. He had his dogs rip them apart. He was very, very brutal. He ruled that area through fear and had absolutely no respect for anybody. He made promises and\nbroke them all the time. He was really, he was a brutal man. - So this whole period when\nChristopher Columbus came, how did that change everything? - Well, you know, there's a great anthropological\nbody of literature. It's called the Colombian\nExchange, based on Columbus. But it's, you know, all this trade back and forth between the new\nworld and the old world. And the old world got\njust wonderful stuff. All of a sudden their diet didn't suck. All these vegetables came in. The new world got herd animals. It got pigs and cows and\ngoats that it didn't have, but it also got 13 infectious diseases. Europe had had wave after wave and kind of had herd\nimmunity on a lot of things. But it didn't actually go away. It just couldn't spread like a wildfire through the community. So when they arrived to the Americas, all of a sudden these just a pile of horrible diseases hit people. I think in the first 20,\n30 years there were people who like had contracted\nmultiple deadly diseases at once and died of them. But the numbers, you know, it's a shameful part of history. And it wasn't something that\nEurope perpetrated on them, but the medical science at that time was still\nthe four humors theory that people were made of yellow bile, black bile, blood, and phlegm. And we did things like,\nwell, you've gotta bleed him. He'll feel better then. So we had no idea what an\ninfectious disease was, but the reality was that this hoard of diseases hit everyone. And the numbers are now\nsaying in the first 50 years that 90% of everybody was dead. And that the number of\npeople has increased as well. As far as our estimates, we're thinking it's somewhere\naround 150 million people and 90% of them died. And with them all their knowledge and just, I mean, imagine\nthe moment where, you know, who dies when things get bad,\nit's the young and the old. So all the knowledge keepers die suddenly, the children die. This next generation that's half taught and now completely demoralized, thinking that this is a spiritual attack, that their gods hate them. That the only way out of it is to accept this new Christianity. But they, you know, they\ndon't wanna bring kids into this world where everybody's dying. And even if they do, they can't teach them what the old people were gonna teach them 'cause the old people are gone and didn't finish the transmission. So in a single terrible\nmoment in human history, you know, the generation\nloses all their knowledge. So a lot of the things that these people knew just blipped out. - But with that also just the wisdom of the entire civilizations. - So much of what they knew\nwas just lost at that moment. We have the Maya who had those hieroglyphs and that we've learned a lot from that. - Yeah, but not a significant integration of that wisdom into, so it wasn't, when the Europeans came, it wasn't like the\ncultures were integrated. It was a story of domination,\nof erasure, essentially. - In North America, there's a new term in the\nliterature that I like, we call it the Mississippian shatter zone. That Mississippian civilization\nwas millions of people, but they got spread out all over the place over the next centuries. And now we have this shatter zone where we have ruins and the people that were actually from those\nruins are somewhere else on a reservation far away. And, you know, I'm just about\nto talk to a Cherokee man who listened to some of\nthe things I had to say and says all those Ho-Chunk\nthings you were saying from that whole Ho-Chunk culture. My grandparents talk about\nthis sort of thing too. Can I talk to you by phone and tell you about these things? So we've got this shatter\nzone where, you know, we're gonna try to put\nthe puzzle back together. Especially in terms of\nMississippian religion. I really think we're making\nheadway in this generation. And it's exciting to be part\nof piecing this old religion and its mythology back together. - Just since a lot of people kind of refer to Christopher Columbus as the person who discovered America. I read that the Vikings\nreached North America much earlier in 1000 BCE. And why do you think they\ndidn't expand and colonize? - Because they got their ass kicked. - Okay, simple.\n- It's the truth. It is absolutely true that\nthe Vikings were here. There's a great site in Nova Scotia called L'Anse aux Meadows, which definitely has what's\nleft of a Viking colony. It was Leif Erik and his father Erik the\nRed, who they got kind of kicked outta Europe\n'cause they apparently couldn't stop murdering people. And so they went to Greenland and then kind of island\nhopped over to Canada. But I think the culture that was in that area\nwas named the Dorset. But they would have nothing\nto do with the Vikings. They attacked the Viking\nsettlement every day and did not give them an inch until they decided it was just worthless. And they left it, you know,\nthe Vikings attacked Ireland and they just found a bunch of, you know, monasteries full of gold\nwith a bunch of guys going, we're men of God, we don't fight. And the Vikings were like,\nthis is great, that's great. This'll be easy then we'll just\nloot all these Easter eggs. But the Native Americans in\nCanada were like not having it. They kicked their ass, in fact, Leif Erikson's brother Thor died there. The natives killed him. He was supposed to be in charge\nof expanding the settlement, but they just killed him. - So a lot of the Native\nAmerican cultures were also, I mean, they're sophisticated\nwarring cultures also. - Yes, they fought,\nespecially the Mississippians, boy, they were tough. And so were, you know, the\nFive Nations, the Mohawk, the Huron, the ones that kicked\nthe Vikings' ass up there. They were probably Algonquian speakers, but they were connected like, you know, just above the Great Lakes. But they were all very tough people. - When you think about the\nSpaniards and the Portuguese and over a hundred million\npeople that were killed, do you see that as a tragedy of history or is it just the way of history? - I think that the epidemics,\nI consider it a tragedy that did not have to happen. And that was not, you know,\nthat was not a fair fight. Nobody knew what to do about it. There was just a tragic,\nperfect storm of events. It was not, you know, I\nthink that the Spanish and the Portuguese get unfairly maligned in what's been called the black legend that they just marched into\nAmerica and murdered everyone. That's not the fact. It was the diseases\nthat murdered everyone. In fact, there was a really\npoignant story I read of a Spanish priest in the Amazon in the Brazilian northern\npart of the Amazon where he made this utopian community and he was bringing people\nin that were getting sick. And he wrote, you know,\nI'm baptizing everyone, you know, I have baptized\n10,000 people a day, and yet God's still killing them. What, why is he doing this to them? They're doing everything\nthat I ask them to do. They are submitting to the will of God. But this guy doesn't\nrealize that the same bowl of holy water that he's baptizing them in, he's just wiping the disease\non everybody's faces. He's accelerating it when\nhe doesn't even realize. He thinks he's saving them,\nbut he's actually killing them. - Yeah.\n- That's a tragedy. You know, that's not just like spoils go to the victor stuff. That's just straight up tragedy. - Yeah, yeah, but that one is hard to know what to do with like black death. It's, I mean, infections, they don't operate on\nnormal human terms, right. They just go through entire populations. Back to wild ideas. - All right, just my style. - I mean, we didn't really talk about how life originated on Earth or how humans have evolved. And we did talk about that\nthere could be just a lot of stuff in ancient history\nwe haven't even uncovered yet. Do you think it's possible that other intelligent civilizations from outside of Earth,\naliens ever visited? - You had me right until\nthe ever visited thing. That one I'm not entirely sure about. I'm not sure whether we have any, we certainly have no archeological\nproof that I would cite or contemplate as the evidence of such. But, you know, the guys\nthat discovered DNA, Watson and Crick, Watson, who actually\nhabitually used hallucinogens to invigorate his thinking,\nhe said that he thought that DNA on this planet\nwas way too complex to have developed over the time period that it had at its disposal. And that his guess was that our DNA was somehow seeded\nfrom outside of our planet and, you know, take that for what it is. But the guy who we respect on many other levels also said that. So that's interesting,\nbut in terms of, you know, aliens visiting us, I don't know, it does smack of a kind of human hubris that we think we're important enough for some advanced species\nto give a shit about us. Statistically speaking, the\nuniverse is way too big. We can't be the only sentient beings. There's gotta be somebody else out there whether they care about\nus, that's a question. I've been on \"Ancient\nAliens\" a number of times. I show up and, you know, I'm an educator. I mean, refusing to be part of the conversation's an\nimmediate fail in my book. But there was one time where\nthey asked me at the end, you know, do you have anything\nelse that you wanna say? And I said, well, you know, yeah. Y'all's premise is that aliens\ncame down a long time ago and they gave humanity these\nwonderful gifts of, you know, science and medicine,\nengineering, all these things. Today we also have a lot of stories of the aliens coming down, but now all they're\ndoing is mutilating cows and sodomizing rednecks. Like whatever we did, we super\npissed them off, apparently. - The quality of the gifts\nhas decreased rapidly. What it's an interesting\nthought you've mentioned. What archeologically would you have to see to be like, this might be an alien? - A technology that doesn't belong there, first and foremost. I mean, you know, we gotta, if we just run with the premise\nthat somebody was capable of making a vehicle that could get them from\nsomewhere far away to here, that was almost certainly mechanical. Now, you know, I love the\naliens thing where, you know, biomechanical is something\nthat certainly could be and that would, you know,\nthat would disintegrate. We wouldn't see that at all. But I would expect some kind of technology that showed up out of the\nblue and changed things. That would be something. But I would think, you know, mechanical. Or, you know, a substance\nthat's not from here. - But of course we would\nonly see the results of that mechanical, you mean like literally\na mechanical thing? - Right, some sort of thing like that. The typical thing people\nsay is like, you know, how did they move these\ngiant stones, right? But, you know, just look at that on the face for a second. Aliens come from across\nthe universe to meet humans and the thing they tell\nthem is how to move rocks. Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, you know, like\ngive them antibiotics or a combustion engine or something. They came across the universe and they showed 'em how to move big rocks. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, that just doesn't make any sense. - What do you think Earth will look like 10,000 years from now? - That's a interesting question. I think it will be a lot more automated or it'll be a smoldering pile. I mean, there is a possibility\nwe could end ourselves. There's always that possibility that we've really opened\nPandora's box in some regards. I did listen to one of your podcast guests with the what would happen\nin the case of nuclear war. That was chilling. Her opinion was certainly\nwe would burn everything to a crisp within minutes apparently. So we have that capacity, that's scary. That's a possible future\nfor us, but I'm an optimist. You know, I'd like to think that guys like you are\ngonna make friendly robots who make my job better. - But a thousand, 10,000\nyears is a long time and technology is improving and becoming more advanced rapidly, and the rate of that improvement\nis increasing evermore. - That's the part that\nfrightens me actually. I dunno, does that frighten you? - Yeah, it's terrifying.\n- You know, I heard somebody say, I forget who it was, but, you know, systems of any kind, human systems, biological\nsystems can be put on a graph that's change over time. And any graph that the change is way\nfaster than the time. And the line starts going straight up. That is a system in crisis in almost any biological system that has that fast change\nover that little a time. Any other thing, you'd\ndescribe it as a crisis. When you apply that chart to technologies change, it's a crisis. - From that perspective, absolutely. But I also have a faith in human ingenuity that we humans like to create a really difficult situation and then come up with ways to get out of that difficult situation. And in so doing, innovate and\ncreate a lot of awesome stuff and sometimes cause a lot of suffering, but on the whole, on\naverage, make a better world. But yeah, you know, like\nwith nuclear weapons, the bad stuff might actually\nlead to the death of everybody. - I guess there's always that chance. But I am an optimist. You know, I think you're an optimist too. I think exactly as you just said, I think that the greatest capacity of humans is our ability to innovate. And we are never more innovative than when we're under distress. I think that a lot of the developments of humans over the last thousands\nof years have been about, you know, we didn't change the world when we were comfortable, it\nwas when we were in crisis. Mother necessity is the\nmother of invention. And I think we'll be all right. I think that this impending climate crisis is real and happening. I actually personally think that I'm gonna answer a question that you didn't even ask me. I think we're wasting our time thinking that we can reverse this. We're delusional, I'm\nall for electric cars and, you know, being good\nstewards of the environment, but we are wasting our time not technologically adapting\nto what's about to happen. We're spending too much\ntime pretending, you know, the average American thinks if we all just drive\nelectric cars, we'll be okay. That's bullshit, that's not gonna happen. We need to start making\ntechnologies that desalinize water, that, you know, a host\nof things that we need to use our technological\ncapacity to accept it and adapt instead of Pollyanna thinking we can make it go away. - Yeah, yeah, kind of accept\nthat the world will change and a lot of big problems will arise and just develop technology\nthat addresses them. - I think you have some guys that have their finger on the pulse there. We need to start thinking about how we're gonna survive this. Not that we're gonna make it go away. - And not just survive, thrive. Again, we're pretty\ninnovative in that regard, but if some catastrophic thing happens or we just leave this planet, what do you think would be found by aforementioned alien civilizations when they visit. The anthropologist, the\ngrad student anthropologist that visit Earth and study, how much of what we now have and love and think of\nas human civilization will be lost, do you think? - Well, you know, time moves on and things that are perishable perish. So, you know, you didn't\nput a time element in there, but I would say that, you know, everything that can perish will, and whoever shows up here will be stuck with only the things that didn't perish. So we'll have, you know,\nbuildings, plaques, but they won't have any books. They won't have any, you know, billboards. They'll have the incomplete record I have. I one time did a talk in Sioux Falls and I said, you know, I drove in here and there was a big obelisk\nin front of the town and everywhere I go, I see\nthe names Lewis and Clark. And a thousand years from now, if I was an archeologist\ninvestigating this place, I would think that it was\nfounded by the Egyptians and their kings were\nnamed Lewis and Clark. But the truth is, you know, Lewis and Clark stayed one night here, but it's just a big deal. So I would be so wrong about\nwhat I thought about your town based on what preserved. - That's so beautiful\nas a thought experiment. Like what would archeologists\nbe really wrong about and what would they could\npossibly be right about. - Washington DC was clearly\nmade by a combination of the Egyptians and the\nGreeks and the Romans, because that's what all\nthe architecture is. - Yeah, and would they be able to reconstruct the important empires, the powerful empires\nand the warring empires. - For that matter, have me and my colleagues\ndone that at all? I'm almost certain that the\nMaya would just gut laugh at what I think I know what they were. - I wonder, do you ever\nthink about like what we just as a human civilization\nare wrong about the most, like mainstream archeology,\njust like a suspicion, what could we get completely wrong? Well, one way to get something wrong is totally like lost civilization. Like an obviously gigantic\ncivilization that was there along with the Maya or something like this in the 10,000 years ago. - There's certainly that\nthere could be things that were either wiped away or still hiding under the oceans that would completely change\nthe way we think about things. - And everybody knew they existed and everybody interact with 'em. - I think that's our estimation of their motivations that\nwe're probably most wrong on. My teacher Sheila, a long time ago said, you know, I've come up\nwith all sorts of theories. I was always thinking about\nstuff and she looked at me and she said, if you don't stop thinking like a Western European and start trying to put\nyourself in the mindset of these people, you will\nnever understand any of it. Which I've always taken to\nheart, I mean, I really do. When I approach these\nthings, I try to step out of my cultural assumptions, try to think like they would think as the best I could. And it's very different. I mean this whole, you\nknow, the Maya are cyclical, you know, the whole sacrifice, were so, you know, obsessed with that. But, you know, that was a\naustere actual sacrifice on their part. They weren't just, you know,\nhey, let's all get together and kill that guy that's pissing us off. I mean, they were like, you\nknow, giving the best of them. It was a different mentality,\nthis was not brutal. This was a, you know, bonafide sacrifice on their part, a loss. - Plus the whole mystery of the puppy that eventually starts\nhaving sex with this. - I tell you, that one,\nI'm gonna unweave that one, one of these days. - Now that puppy appeared on pottery. - All over pottery. He's everywhere, I gotta write this book. This next year is the year I'm gonna write my fanged deity book. And I will have a whole chapter dedicated to the puppy. - Mystery solved, I mean, it could just be the\nbirth of memes, of humor. I don't know, I mean,\nagain, humor, you don't know what the nature of their\nhumor, of what their jokes are. - Oh, that's a neat one\ntoo, and that's so human. You know, I'll tell you a\nlittle like side story here that when I worked with the\nMaya people in Palenque, I spent three years making\nthis map of the city and hiking through the jungle every day. And they would talk to each\nother in their own language. It was tseltal was the\ngroup I was working with. But I noticed after a\nwhile, they were big jokers. They loved to make jokes and\nthey would laugh at jokes, but then they would also, one\nof them would say something and the other ones would go, hoo hoo. And I eventually asked,\nyou know, what is that? Why do you guys always\nmake that hoo hoo noise? And he said, that's 'cause\nhe made a really smart pun. It was like he said three\ndifferent things at once. It was a turn of phrase that was smart. And they didn't make laughs at that. It was, they had a noise for when somebody said\nsomething just super clever. So there's also that like, you know, just clever turn of speech. - Yeah, wit. - And I think about that when\nI'm a hieroglyphic translator. Like, here's a beautiful thing\nthat's gonna be like a poem or a political statement. Like, and I'm just plottingly looking in a dictionary of what that word means. There's probably double, triple entendres all through this text. And the real meaning is the subtext. And I'm, you know, I'm thinking\nthey're talking about corn and they're talking\nabout the nature of life. - Yeah, it could be satire,\nit could be, you know, as it was in the Soviet Union\nwhen there's a dictator, maybe there's a overpowering king. You're not allowed to actually speak. You have to hide the thing you're actually trying\nto say in the subtext. So, and all of that. - There was a funny Maya ceramic that had, the ceramics are neat 'cause they don't, the monuments can be\nkind of broken records. I'm the king, I was born this\ntime, I beat these people up. I married this woman, I died. But the ceramics will\ntell us like things out of mythology stories. And there was this one\nwith a rabbit looking at the merchant god, and nobody\ncould translate the text. And finally this eastern European, actually a Ukrainian guy translated it and the rabbit's saying\nto the merchant god, bend over and smell my ass. And like, oh man, we were expecting this\nwonderful piece of mythology. But no, it translates bend\nover and smell my ass. That's great, that's human. - As we mentioned previously,\nhuman nature does not change. You mentioned Palenque, mapping it. Just outta curiosity, what is that process like,\nit seems fascinating. - Oh, it was a great\nadventure, I loved it. But it was difficult. I woke up every morning thinking I will be hurt today somehow. I don't know how, I don't know how badly, where on my body it will\noccur, but it's gonna happen because it was the jungle. - So in the jungle,\nwhat's the process like? Like what do you have to do to map it? - Well, it was tricky too because it was also a national forest. So the forestry department didn't want us to cut down anything more than we had to. So we basically just cut\ntunnels through the foliage and I would, we'd map everything twice. The first thing we'd do is\nI'd go in, find a building, draw it on a piece of graph paper, and I'd say like, you\nknow, you guys go north, you guys go east, west,\nfind other buildings, and when you find them\npace back to this one. And so I'd start making a map and I'd make the whole, one\npiece of graph paper was enough to then we'd bring the machine in, we'd bring the laser theodolite and get really accurate information. But on that piece of\npaper, I would write like, don't bring the machine this way. There's a tree fall or stand\non top of this building and you'll see four different buildings at once from this one. - And all of this is in dense jungle. - Right, and the deeper\nwe got off the road, the deeper it was, sometimes\nit would clear out, but certain places, if it was low, it would be such thick vegetation and it would grow back so fast. Sometimes we would cut just\ntunnels through tall grass and we'd come back like five\ndays later and they were gone. We couldn't even find\nwhere our trails were. They would grow back that fast. - But you see the\nbuilding so you could see. - Right, and that was the fun part. I mean, sometimes it would just be like a little neighborhood\nwith little low buildings, no bigger than this table,\nbut sometimes, you know, just five more meters in. And I'm standing under a pyramid that nobody had ever mapped. Like, wow, I've just found another one. And some days, you know, on good days we'd find three pyramids. And I felt that's such a more exciting job than the typical excavations. Although my buddies were all\njust, you know, in a hole for the whole week in\nthe middle of the city and where I'm dancing\naround through the jungle, I could find, you know,\n10 buildings today. I might find a pyramid today, who knows. - What's that feel like\nto find like a pyramid or buildings that you are\none of the only humans that are not from that civilization\nto ever see this thing? What's that feel like? - It's great, I love that feeling. I am, you know, I'm an explorer at heart, so finding something like that, you know, when I was 25 years old,\nI found a whole Maya city. I got to name it, its name is Ma'ax Na, it's off in the Belizean jungle. And that was just, just outrageous. I mean, it almost, that\none almost depressed me. My entire, like, I had\nthis great life ambition that I would find a lost city. And then I did it at 25 and I was like, God, now what do I do? I thought that was supposed\nto take me my whole life. I actually, I wrote a bunch\nof letters to NASA trying to get them to let me be the\nfirst archeologist on Mars. I never got a single reply back. I'm sure I'm on NASA's\nlist as some weirdo. - How'd you find a Mayan city? - I used a topography map of the area and I played the game. If I was a Maya, where\nwould my favorite place to live in this big area be? I looked for the biggest mountain because they call all of\ntheir pyramids tunwits, stone mountains, I knew\nthey loved mountains. And when I found that mountain, there were two others right\nnext to it that made a triangle. And they loved those triads and there were rivers in between them. And I thought, that's it. That's where I would build the city. And I hiked out there over\ntwo seasons with students. The other grad students were like, he's just having his students just wander in the jungle all day, but\nI came back with the city. - So given that you've looked into the deep pasts of humanity, what gives you hope about our future, maybe our deep future of\nthis human civilization? - That's a good one, and I do have hope. I do have hope, I believe\nin the spirit of humankind. I, as a person who have studied history, I kind of feel like history\ndoes kind of a sine wave. There's highs and there's lows, but no matter how low we go, we get up again and we climb. And I think that humanity\nwill continue that, we will rise to the challenges. Now, some of the challenges\nmay be created by ourselves as well, but we will adapt and overcome. That's what we do. - Yeah, humans find a way, right? That's like, that's the\nthing you see with history, even when the empires collapse. The humans that come outta that, they pick themselves up\nand find another way. - And the people I study\nbelieve in the cyclical nature of life that you really can't, life can't continue without\ndeath being part of the cycle. We get our lows, we get our highs, but the cycle continues forever. - I should mention that you\nhave a lot of great lectures on the great courses, but you\nhave also an amazing podcast, ArchaeoEd, if people wanna listen to it, this is a tough question, but what would you recommend, what episodes should they\nlisten to, what's the entry? - Oh, that is a tough question. - What is the sampling? You know, it's like asking a chef, like what's the best stuff on the menu? - Well, different strokes\nfor different folks. You know, I do two different\nthings on that podcast. Sometimes I just teach about cultures that you've never heard about. I start off by saying it's my podcast and I'll talk about whatever\nthe heck I wanna talk about. Sometimes I talk about\nreally specific things like a tool type or an animal type. But my favorite ones have become, when I just tell my\nstories of my adventures, I've got a lot of weird adventure stories and it's been fun and they've\nbeen very well received. I've got, you know, I\ncan put my humor in there and I can talk about, you know, the things that went right, the things\nthat went wrong, the adventures that I had are all part\nof this ArchaeoEd thing. And ArchaeoEd's kind of a double entendre. It's me, I'm just Ed,\nbut it's also education. You know what I'm really\ntrying to do with this too, it's specifically the Americas. I want to be part of the reawakening that there were these\ngreat civilizations here, especially North America. I think that we have a group amnesia that there was no great civilizations here before Europe showed up,\nthat's simply not true. I think it should be part\nof our history books. In fact, I have a program\ncalled Before the Americas that would introduce as\npart of American history, the part before European contact. And I think that kids in the K through 12 level should grow up not being told this fallacy that no one was here before\nwe showed up in 1492. And one of these days\nI'm gonna find a funder to help us put together\nBefore the Americas and we're gonna make it\npart of the curriculum for every kid in the US to know the full history of this country. - That's a great project,\nEd, thank you so much. Thank you for talking today. Thank you for all the fascinating ideas that you put out into the world and I can't wait to hear your new course. - Thank you so much, Lex,\nit was a real pleasure. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Ed Barnhart.

And now let me leave you some\nwords from Joseph Campbell. \"Life is but a mask worn\non the face of death and is death then, but another mask, how many can say asks the Aztec poet that there is or is not a truth beyond?\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
