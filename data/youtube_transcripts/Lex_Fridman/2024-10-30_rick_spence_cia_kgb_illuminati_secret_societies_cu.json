  "full_text": "- Most people, most of the time, are polite, cooperative, and kind, until they're not. - The following is a\nconversation with Rick Spence, a historian specializing in the history of intelligence agencies,\nespionage, secret societies, conspiracies, the occult,\nand military history. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Rick Spence. You have written and lectured\nabout serial killers, secret societies, cults,\nand intelligence agencies. So we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics. But let's begin with\nintelligence agencies. Which has been the most powerful intelligence\nagency in history? - The most powerful\nintelligence agency in history? I mean, it's an interesting question. I'd say probably in terms\nof historical longevity and consistency of performance, that the Russian intelligence services, notice I didn't say the KGB specifically, but the Russian intelligence services, going back to the Tsarist period, are consistently pretty good. Not infallible. None of them are. Of course, there's a common\nWestern way of looking at anything Russian. Very often, I think it's still the case, Russians are viewed in one of two ways. Either they are bumbling idiots, or they are diabolically clever. No sort of middle ground. And you can find both of\nthose examples in this. So what I mean by that\nis that if you're looking at the modern SVR, or FSB, which are just two different\norganizations that used to be part of the one big KGB, or the KGB or its predecessors, the CheKa, you're really going back\nto the late 19th century and the Imperial Russian\nIntelligence Security Service, generally known as the\nOkhrana or Okhranka. It's really the Department of Police, the Special Corps of Gendarmes. Their primary job was\nprotecting the Imperial regime and protecting it against Imperial, or\nrather, interior enemies. Revolutionaries, for the most part. And they got very, very good at that. By co-opting people\nwithin those movements, infiltrating and recruiting informers, agent provocateurs, in fact, they excelled at the agent provocateur. Person you place inside an organization to cause trouble, usually\nmaneuver them into a position of leadership, and they provoke actions that can then allow you\nto crack down on them. That is, to sort of lure or\nbring the target organization into any legal or open status that it can be more\neffectively suppressed. They were very good at that. So good that by the early 20th century, in the years preceding the\nRussian Revolution, in 1917, they had effectively\ninfiltrated every radical party Bolsheviks, Mensheviks,\nSrs, great and small, and placed people in positions\nof influence and leadership. To the point that arguably, that is, you can debate this, and I think in the whole,\nthey could largely dictate what those parties did. Nothing was discussed at any\ncentral committee meeting of any revolutionary group that the Okhrana wasn't\nimmediately aware of, and they often had people\nin positions to influence what those decisions were. Of course, that raises\nan interesting question, is that if they were that\ngood and they had infiltrated and effectively controlled\nmost of the opposition, then how did the regime get\noverthrown by revolutionaries? The answer to that is that it wasn't overthrown\nby revolutionaries. It was overthrown by politicians. That would then take us into a detour into Russian history, but\nI'll just leave it with this. If you look at 1917 and you look closely, this is one of the things I would always tell my students, is that there are two\nRussian revolutions in 1917. There's the first one\nin March or February, depending on your calendar,\nthat overthrows Nicholas II. Revolutionaries are really\nnot involved with that. Bolsheviks are nowhere to be seen. Trotsky and Lenin are nowhere to be seen. They have nothing to do with that. That has to do effectively with a political conspiracy within the Russian parliament, the Duma, to unseat an emperor they\nthought was bungling the war and was essentially a loser to begin with. And it was a coup d'état, a\nparliamentary coup d'état. The temporary or provisional government that that revolution put in\npower was the one overthrown by Lenin eight months later. And that government was\nessentially one dominated by moderate socialists. It was a government that\nvery quickly sort of turned to the left. The guy we associate with\nthat is Alexander Kerensky. Alexander Kerensky was a\nRussian socialist, a politician. He was the quasi-dictator of that regime. He's the person, not the czar,\nwho's overthrown by Lenin. So the revolutionaries,\nthey did not prove to be the fatal threat to the czarist regime. It was the czarist political\nsystem itself that did that. What then transpired was that\nthe Okhrana and its method and many of its agents\nthen immediately segued over into the new Soviet security service. So one of the first things\nthat Lenin did in December of 1917, within a month of seizing power, since the hold on power\nwas tenuous at best, was that, well, you're\ngoing to need some kind of organization to infiltrate and suppress those pesky\ncounter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists\nand all of the other enemies that we have. And so the extraordinary commission to combat counter-revolution and sabotage, the CheKa was formed. You put a veteran Bolshevik,\nFelix Dzerzhinsky, at the head of that, someone you could politically rely upon. But Dzerzhinsky built his\norganization essentially out of the Okhrana. I mean, there were all of these informers sitting\naround with nothing to do. And they were employed. In the early '20s, the kind of rank and file of\nthe CheKa might have been 80% to 90% former imperial officials. Those were gradually decreased over time. So why would they do that?\nWell, they were professionals. They also needed to eat, and things were somewhat precarious. So if your job is to be\nan agent provocateur, if your job is to infiltrate\ntargeted organizations and lead them astray, you do\nthat for whoever pays you. That's part of the\nprofessionalism which goes in. And under the Soviets, the Soviet intelligence services\nare also very good at that. They are very good at infiltrating people into opposing organizations. And I guess the one example\nI would give to demonstrate that are the Cambridge\nFive, the British traitors, from a Soviet standpoint,\nheroes, who were recruited, most notably Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald\nMaclean, Anthony Blunt. And there may have been\nwell more than five, but that wasn't bad out of just Cambridge. And then placing those\npeople in high positions, the ultimate goal, of course, is to get your people into\npositions of leadership and influence in the opposing\nintelligence service. And so they did. Of\ncourse, it all fell apart. And they ended up in, you know, Philby ended up living the\nlast part of his life in exile in Moscow, but they got their\nmoney's worth out of him. And you can also find\nthis in KGB infiltration of the CIA, the FBI, the Aldrich\nAmes, Robert Hanssen cases. Of course, we were infiltrating, by we I mean the Americans\nand the West managed to infiltrate our moles as well. But if it came down, you know,\nsomeone could dispute this, but I would think if you\nwere going to come down to a kind of like a who had the most moles Super Bowl, probably the Soviets would\ncome somewhat ahead of that. - So the scale of the\ninfiltration, the number of people, and the skill of it. Is there a case to be\nmade that the Okhrana and the CheKa orchestrated\nboth the components of the Russian revolution\nas you describe them? - Well, there's an\ninteresting question for me. I mean, there are all kinds\nof questions about this. I mean, one of the questions\nis whether or not Lenin was an Okhrana agent. Okay, I've just said heresy. I will do that quite often\nbecause I am a heretic and proud of it.\n- Great. (laughs) - Why would you possibly say\nthat Lenin could have been an Okhrana agent? Well, let's look what he managed to do. So you had, coming into the 20th century, a single, well, nominally,\na single Marxist movement, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, and Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, the majority-ites and\nminority-ites are merely factions of that party. And they always agreed\nthat they were all Marxists and we all believe in\ndialectical materialism and the rise of, we're\nall socialist, comrade. The difference was the tactical means by which one would attain this. And what Lenin wanted was a militant,\nsmall-scale, vanguard party. He wanted a revolution. He wanted to seize power,\nseize control of the state, and once you have the state, then you induce socialism from above. Whereas the majority of the people, the so-called Mensheviks,\nthe minority-ites, who are, oddly enough, the vast\nmajority of the party, that's one of the first things, how do you lose that argument? Okay, how does the minority get to grab the name majority-ites? But Lenin did that. So what Lenin wanted was\na conspiratorial party of committed revolutionaries\nthat would plot and scheme and undermine and eventually\nseize control of the state and induce socialism from above. There were other Russian\nMarxists who thought that that sounded vaguely totalitarian and not really democratic,\nnot even terribly socialist. And they opposed that, ineffectively from the beginning, outmaneuvered\nevery step of the way. The Mensheviks are a case study in failure of a political organization. That too will be heresy to some\npeople, but look, they lost. Now, so what Lenin managed to do, starting around\n1903, continuing under this, is he managed to divide, to take what had been\na single Marxist party and split it into angry,\ncontending factions. Because he and his\nBolsheviks were on one side, advocating a much more\nmilitant, conspiratorial policy, the discombobulated Mensheviks\nwere over on the other, and in between were a lot of people who really didn't know\nwhere they stood on this. I mean, sometimes they\nkind of agree he seems to be making sense today. No, no, I don't think he's\nmaking sense on that day. But he managed to completely\ndisunify this organization. Now, who could possibly\nhave seen benefit in that? The Okhrana. Now, whether or not they put him up to it, whether or not in some\nway they helped move him into a position of\nleadership or encouraged it, or encouraged it through\npeople around him, whether he was a witting\nor unwitting agent of the Tsar's secret police, he certainly accomplished exactly what it was that they had wanted. And I find that suspicious\nis one of those things that it's so convenient in a way is that I'm not necessarily\nsure that was an accident. There's also this whole question to me as to what was going on\nwithin the Okhrana itself. Now, this is one of these\nquestions we may come to later about how\nintelligence agencies interact or serve the governments to which they are theoretically subordinate. They do tend to acquire a great\ndeal of influence and power. After all, their main job\nis to collect information. And that information\ncould be about all kinds of things, including people within the government structure itself. And they also know how to\nleverage that information in a way to get people to\ndo what you want them to do. So an argument can be made,\nagain, an argument, not a fact, merely an opinion, which is mostly what history\nis made out of, opinions, is that at some point\nbetween about 1900 and 1917, people within the Okhrana\nwere playing their own game. And that game took them\nin a direction which meant that continued loyalty to the emperor, specifically to Nicholas II,\nwas no longer part of that. To me, in a way, it seems almost during the\nevents of 1917 that one, you had an organization\nthat was very effective for what it did that suddenly\njust becomes ineffective. It doesn't really disappear. These things don't go away\nbecause it will reappear as the VeCheKa basically fairly quickly. But it raises the question to me is to what degree there were people within the organization\nwho allowed events to take the course they wished? - I always wonder how much\ndeliberate planning there is within an organization like Okhrana, or if there's kind of a distributed\nintelligence that happens? - Well, one of the key\nelements in any kind of intelligence organization or operation is compartmentalization, need to know. So rarely do you have an\noccasion where everybody, everybody in an executive\nposition are all brought into a big corporate\nmeeting and we discuss all of the secret operations\nthat are going on. No, no, you never do that. Only a very limited number of\npeople should know about that. If you have a person who is a case officer who's controlling\nagents, he's the only one who should know who those people are, possibly his immediate superiors, but in no way do you want\nthat to be common knowledge. So information within the organization itself\nis compartmentalized. So you don't need\neverybody to be in on it. You don't even need necessarily the people who are nominally at the top. First is the Okhrana, the real boss of the Okhrana was the Imperial Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, in fact, but the Minister of the Interior had no real effective\ncontrol over this at all. I mean, to the point was\nthat at one point early on, they actually organized the\nassassination of their own boss. They have their agents among\nthe revolutionaries kill the Minister of the Interior, because he'll just be\nreplaced by another one. He is an Imperial bureaucrat. He's not really part\nof their organization. You know, it's like a director of an intelligence agency\nappointed by the president. Maybe he's part of the organization. Maybe he isn't, maybe he is not one of us. So you've got different levels, different compartments within it. And who's actually running the show? If anyone is, I don't know. That's never supposed to be apparent. - Well, that's a fascinating question. I mean, you could see this with NKVD. It's obviously an extremely\npowerful organization that starts to eat itself, where everybody's pointing\nfingers internally also, as a way to gain more power. So the question is, in\norganizations like that, that are so compartmentalized,\nwhere's the power? Where's the center of power? Because you would think,\ngiven that much power, some individual or a group of individuals will start\naccumulating that power. But it seems like that's\nnot always a trivial thing, because if you get too powerful,\nthe snake eats that person. - Well, if we go back again to the founder of Soviet secret police,\nFelix Dzerzhinsky. Dzerzhinsky dies in 1926. Keels over after giving a heated\nspeech to a party meeting. Now, the common view,\nwhat you usually read, which was key for the\ntime, is that, you know, clearly Stalin had him whacked, because anytime someone died,\nit was almost always that. And I think a lot of times he did. But in some cases, Stalin's probably\ngetting blamed for things that he didn't actually do. Dzerzhinsky wasn't even opposed to Stalin, so it's not clear why he would. But this was the, you know, someone died, obviously, he was poisoned,\nsomething happened. It was an unnatural death. Somebody goes in for an operation, gets a little too much\nanesthesia, Stalin killed them. Somebody tips over in a\ncanoe in upstate New York, Stalin killed them. There's\nactually a case about that. So that itself can be kind of useful, where every time someone dies,\nthey think you killed them. That's kind of an interesting\nmethod of intimidation in that regard. But the suspicion is nonetheless there. Dzerzhinsky had been, he\nwas the Grand Inquisitor. He was seemingly firmly in\ncontrol of the organization. Of course, maybe he wasn't. Maybe he was, my guess would be is that Dzerzhinsky's death\nwas not natural causes, but he was probably eliminated by someone within his own organization. And then you look at the\npeople who take over. His immediate successor\nis Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, who's really not really\na secret policeman, more a kind of intellectual dilettante. But if you look behind him, you'll notice the fellow\nis Genrikh Yagoda. And Yagoda will really sort\nof manage things from behind the scenes until Menzhinsky dies in 1934. And then Yagoda will hold\non till he's a victim of the purges, I think in '37 or '38. Yagoda is ambitious, murderous, and if I was going to\npoint the finger to anybody who possibly had Dzerzhinsky\nwhacked, it would be him, and for the purposes\nsimply of advancement. That's the, you know, the person to look out at any kind of corporate organization is\nyour immediate subordinate, the person who could move into your job, because more than likely that's exactly what they're planning to do. - Yeah, just one step\naway from the very top. Somebody there will probably\naccumulate the most power. You mentioned that the various\nRussian intelligence agencies were good at creating agent\nprovocateurs infiltrating the halls of power. What does it take to do that? - Well, there's an interesting\nlittle acronym called MICE, M-I-C-E, and it's generally used, and it's just the way in\nwhich you would acquire. How do you get people to work for you? Well, M stands for money. You pay them. People are greedy. They want money. You know, if you look at\nAldrich Ames, he had a very, very expensive wife with expensive tastes, so he wanted money. I is for ideology. So during particularly in\nthe 1920s and the 1930s, the Soviets were very effective in exploiting communists, you know, people who wanted to\nserve the great cause, even though that's initially\nnot really what they wanted to do, because the idea was\nthat if you recruit agents from among, let's say,\nAmerican communists, you compromise the party, because exactly what your\nenemies are going to say is that all communists are Soviet spies, they're all traitors in some way, so you would really want to keep those two things separate, but ideology was just so convenient, and those people would\njust work for you so well. You could get them to do anything,\nbetray their grandmother. They would go ahead and do\nthat for the greater good. So ideology can be a motivation, and that can be someone who is a devoted Marxist Leninist. It can also be someone who's a disgruntled\ncommunist because, you know, there's no anti-communist\nlike an ex-communist. Those who lose the faith can\nbecome very, very useful. For instance, if you look in the case of American intelligence, the people who essentially temporarily destroyed much of the KGB organization in the US post-World War II were people like Whittaker Chambers, Louis\nBudenz, Elizabeth Bentley. All of those people have\nbeen Communist Party members. They had all been part\nof the red faithful. They all, for one reason or another, became\ndisillusioned, and turned rat or patriot, whichever\ncase you may want to put in that regard. - What does the C and the E stand for? - The C is for coercion. That's where you have to\npersuade someone to work for you. You have to pressure them. So\nusually you blackmail them. You know, that could be\nthey have a gambling habit. You know, in the old\ndays it was very often because they were gay. Okay, gets them in a decision where they can be compromised\nand you can get them to do your bidding. Those people usually have a\ncertain amount of control. Here's an interesting example\nof how the Okhrana tended to handle this. I think it's still largely used. You'd round up a bunch of\nrevolutionaries on some charge or another, distributing\nrevolutionary literature, running an illegal printing press. You bring a guy into the\nroom and you say, okay, you're going to work for us. He of course refuses to do so. They go, well, if you refuse, we'll keep the rest of\nyour comrades in jail for a while, you know, maybe beat them with a\nrubber truncheon or so. And then we're just going to let you go. We're just going to put\nyou back out on the street. And if you don't work for us, we will spread the rumor\nthrough our agents already in your organization that you are. And then what will your comrades do? How long are you going to live? So you see, you have no choice. You're ours and you're\ngoing to cooperate with us. And the way that that\neffectiveness would be ensured is that you have multiple agents within the same\norganization who don't know who each other are. That's very important. And\nthey'll all be filing reports. So let's say you have three agents inside the central committee of the SR party, and there's a committee meeting\nand you're going to look at the reports that file. They all better agree\nwith each other, right? If one person doesn't report\nwhat the other two do, then perhaps they're not\nentirely doing their job and they can be liquidated at any time. All you do is drop the dime on them. And this was done periodically. In fact, in some cases, you would betray your own agents just to completely discombobulate\nto the organization. This happened in one\nparticular case around 1908. The fellow who was the head of the chief revolutionary\nterrorist organization, which wasn't Bolshevik, but the so-called\nSocialist Revolutionaries, actually the biggest\nrevolutionary party, the SRs, who aren't even actually\nMarxists, more anarchists. But they went all in for\nthe propaganda of the deed. They really like blowing people up, and carrying out quite\na campaign of terrorism. The fellow who was the head\nof that terrorist organization was a fellow by the name of Yevno Azef. And Yevno Azef was, guess\nwhat? An Okhrana agent. Everything he did, every\nassassination that he planned, he did in consultation with his control. So he'd kind of run out his string. There was increasing suspicion of him. He was also asking for a lot more money. So the Okhrana itself arranged\nto have him write it out. And what did that do? Well, what do you do in\nyour party when you find out the chief of your terrorist brigade was a secret police agent? It's consternation and mistrust. Nobody in the party would ever trust and you couldn't tell who\nyou were sitting around. I know that a fellow I wrote a biography on, Boris Savinkov, who was a Russian\nrevolutionary and the second in command within the\nterrorist organization. By the way, the guy that\nwanted Azef's job so bad he could taste it. Well, on the one level, he expressed absolute horror that his boss was a police agent. And well, he should, because Savinkov was a police agent too. See, they already had the\nnumber two waiting in the wings to take over. But he was legitimately shocked. He didn't really suspect that. So it's a way of manipulating this. And then finally, we come to the E. That, I think, is the most important, ego. Sometimes people spy or betray because of the egotistical\nsatisfaction that they receive. The sheer kind of\nMachiavellian joy in deceit. An example of that would be Kim Philby, one of the Cambridge Five. Now, Philby was a communist\nand he would argue that he always saw himself as\nserving the communist cause. But he also made this statement, I think it's in the preface\nto his autobiography. And he says, one never\nlooks twice at the offer of service in elite force. He's talking about his recruitment\nby the NKVD in the 1930s. And he was absolutely chuffed by that. The mere fact that they would want him, what he considered to be a first-rate organization would\nwant him, satisfied his ego. And if I was to take a\nguess as to whether it was ideological motivation,\nwhether it was the romance of communism, or there\nwas the appeal of ego that was the most important\nin his career of treason, I'd go with ego. And I think that figures into a... Someone doesn't get the\npromotions that they wanted. Again, if you look at something\nlike Aldrich Ames' career in particular, you've got these kind of... His career in the CIA was hit or miss. He didn't get the postings or promotions that he wanted, his evaluation... He never felt that he got\ncredit for doing that. And that's the type of\nthing that tends to stick in someone's craw, and can lead for egotistical reasons, an\nadded incentive to betray. - Yeah, that there's a boost to the ego when you can deceive, sort of not play by the rules of the world and just play with powerful\npeople like they're your pawns. - You're the only one that knows this. You're the only one that\nknows that the person who is sitting across from you, to which you have sworn your loyalty, you are simultaneously betraying. What a rush that must be for some people. - I wonder how many people\nare susceptible to this. I would like to believe that people have, a lot of people have the\nintegrity to at least withstand the M-I, the money and the ideology, the pull of that, and the ego. - It can also be a combination of the two. I mean, you can create a\nrecipe of these things, certain amount of money, ego, and the little push of coercion but if you don't, well, we'll rat you out, you'll be exposed. - What are some differences\nto you as we look at the history of the 20th century between the Russian intelligence and the American intelligence in the CIA? - If you look at both\nthe Okhrana and the KGB, one of the things that you find consistent is that a single organization\nhandled foreign intelligence, that is spying upon enemy\nor hostile governments, and also internal security. So that's all part of it. Whereas if you look at the\nUS models that evolves, you eventually have the FBI, who under Hoover quite\ninsists that he's going to be the counterintelligence force. Okay, if they're commie\nspies running around America, it's the FBI who's supposed\nto ferret them out. The CIA is not supposed\nto be involved in that. The charter, the basic agreement in 1947, did not give the CIA any... It's often said they\nwere barred from spying on Americans, which isn't quite true. You can always find a way to do that. What they don't have is\nthey don't have any police or judicial powers. They can't run around in the country carrying\nguns to use on people. They can't arrest you.\nThey can't interrogate you. They can't jail you. They have\nno police or judicial powers. Now, that means they have to\nget that from someone else. That doesn't mean that other\nagencies can't be brought in or local police officials, or whatever you need, you\ncan eventually acquire. But they can't do that directly. So you've got this division\nbetween foreign intelligence and domestic\ncounterintelligence, often split between hostile organizations. The relationship between\nthe FBI and the CIA, I think it's fair to say, is\nnot chummy. Never has been. There's always been a\ncertain amount of rivalry and contention between the two. And it's not to say that something like that didn't exist between the domestic counterintelligence and foreign intelligence\ncomponents of the KGB, but there would be less\nof that to a degree because there was a single organization. They're all answerable to the same people. So that gives you a certain,\ngreater amount, I think, of leeway and power because\nyou're controlling both of those ends. I remember somebody telling me once that, and he was a retired KGB officer. There you go, retired. One of the things that he found amusing was that in his role, one of the things that he could be is that he could be anywhere, at any time, in any dress, which meant\nthat he could be in or out of uniform and any place at any time. He was authorized to do that. - So more freedom, more power. - I think one of the\nthings that you would often have the view is that the Russians are simply naturally meaner. There's less respect for human rights. There's a greater tendency to abuse power that one might have. I mean, frankly, they're\nall pretty good at that. And probably it is fair to say that there's probably some degree of cultural differences, not necessarily for institutional reasons, but cultural reasons\nthere could well be things that Americans might balk at doing more than you would find on\nthe Russian or Soviet side of the equations. The other aspect of that is\nthat Russian history is long and contentious and bloody. One of the things it certainly teaches, you never trust foreigners. Every foreign government, anywhere, any country on your border\nis a real or potential enemy. They will all, at some point,\ngiven the chance, invade you. Therefore, they must always be\ntreated with great suspicion. That goes back to something that I think the British observed was that\ncountries don't have friends. They have interests. And those interests can change over time. - Well, the CIA is\nprobably equally suspicious of all other nations. - That's your job. You're supposed to be suspicious. Your job is not to be trusting. Yeah, the basic job of\nan intelligence agency is to safeguard your secrets\nand steal the other guys' and then hide those away. - Are there laws, either\nintelligence agencies, that they're not willing to break? Is it basically a lawless operation to where you can break any law as long as it accomplishes the task? - Well, I think, John le\nCarré, give his pen name. He was talking about his early recruitment into British intelligence. And one of the things he\nremembered being told up front was if you do this, you\nhave to be willing to lie, and you have to be willing to kill. Now, those are things that in ordinary human\ninteractions are bad things. Generally, we don't like\nit when people lie to us. We expect that people will\nact honestly towards us, you know, whether that's\nbeing a businessman you're involved with, your employers... We're often disappointed in that because people do lie\nall the time for a variety of reasons, but honesty is\ngenerally considered to be good. But in a realm where deception is a rule, dishonesty is a virtue. To be good at that, to be able to lie convincingly is good. It's one of the things you need to do. And killing also is\ngenerally frowned upon. You know, put people in prison for that. They're otherwise executed. But in certain circumstances, killing is one of those things that you\nneed to be able to do. So what he felt he was being\ntold in that case is that, you know, once you enter this realm, the same sort of moral rules that apply in general British society do not apply. And if you're squeamish\nabout it, you won't fit in. You have to be able to do those things. - I wonder how often those\nintelligence agencies in the 20th century, and of course, the natural question extending\nit to the 21st century, how often they go to the assassination? How often they go to the kill part of that\nversus just the espionage? - Let's take an example\nfrom American intelligence, from the CIA, 1950s, 1960s\ninto the 1970s, MKUltra. That is a secret program\nwhich was involved with what is generally\ncategorized as mind control, which really means messing\nwith people's heads. And what was the goal of that? Well, there seemed to\nhave been lots of goals, but there was an FBI memo that was, I recently acquired,\nquite legally, by the way, it's declassified, but it's from 1949. So this is only two years after\nthe CIA came into existence. And it's an FBI memo,\nbecause the FBI, of course, is very curious what the CIA is up to. And the FBI are not part of this meeting, but they have someone in. They're sort of spying on what's going on. So there was a meeting which was held in a private apartment in New York. So it's not held in any kind of, it essentially never really happened because it's in somebody's house. And there are a couple of\nguys there from the CIA. One of them is Cleve Backster. Cleve Backster is the great\ngodfather of the lie detector. Pretty much everything that\nwe know or think we know about lie detectors today,\nyou owe to Cleve Backster. He's also the same guy that thought that plants could feel, which somehow was a derivative of his work on lie detectors. So these guys are there\nand they're giving a talk to some military and other personnel. And there are certain\nparts of the document, which are of course redacted, but you could figure out what it is that they're talking about. And they're talking about\nhypnotic suggestion and all the wonderful things that\nyou can potentially do with hypnotic suggestion. And two of the things they\nnote is that one of the things we could potentially do is erase memories from people's minds and\nimplant false memories. That would be really keen to do that, just imagine how that would be done. So here to me is the interesting point. They're talking about this in 1949. MKUltra does not come\nalong until really 1953, although there are all sorts of, you know, Artichoke and others. Everything is sort of leading up to that. It's simply an elaboration of programs that are already there. I don't think that it ultimately matters whether you can implant\nmemories or erase memories. To me, the important\npart is they thought they could and they were going to try to do it. And that eventually is what you find out in the efforts made\nduring the 1950s and '60s through MKUltra, MKSearch, MKNaomi, and all the others that came out. That's one of the things\nthey're working for. And among the few MKUltra era documents that survived, there's that whole question is that you get someone to\nput a gun to someone's head and pull the trigger and\nthen not remember it later. Yeah. You could, interestingly enough. - So non-direct violence,\ncontrolling people's minds, controlling people's minds\nat scale and experimenting with different kinds\nof ways of doing that. - One person put it that\nthe basic argument there or the basic thing you're\nafter was to understand the architecture of the\nhuman mind, how it worked, how it put together, and then how you could\ntake those pieces apart and assemble them in different ways. So this is where hypnosis comes in, which was then still is,\na fairly spooky thing. Nobody's ever explained\nto me exactly what it is. The idea was that could you, you think of the whole\npossibilities in this case, could you create an alternate personality, and use that alternate\npersonality in an agent role, but then be able to turn it on and off. So subsequently, the person, which that personality inhabited, was captured and interrogated, tortured, had their fingernails torn out. They would have no memory of it. They couldn't give any kind\nof secret away because it was embedded in some part\nof their brain where there is a completely different person. I mean, you can just\nimagine the possibilities that you can dream up. And again, it's not, I think, the question as to\nwhether that is possible or whether it was done. Although I suspect that\nboth of those are true, but that you would try to do it. Then imagine the mischief\nthat comes out of that. And one of the big complaints\nfrom a legal standpoint about MKUltra and the\nrest is that you were having medical experiments, essentially, being carried out on people\nwithout their knowledge and against their will,\nwhich is, you know, a no-no. - Yeah, the fact that you're willing to do medical experiments says something about what you're willing to do. And I'm sure that same\nspirit, innovative spirit, persists to this day. And maybe less so, I hope,\nless so in the United States, but probably in other intelligence\nagencies in the world. - Well, one thing that\nwas learned and the reason why most MKUltra and similar\nrecords were destroyed on order in the early '70s, around the time the CIA\nbecame under a certain amount of scrutiny, you know, the mid-70s were not a\ngood time for the agency because you had the Church Committee\nbreathing down their neck. You had all of these assassins. People were asking lots of questions. And so you need to dump this stuff because there's all kinds of it because you were committing crimes against American citizens. So let's eradicate it. And the important lesson to\nbe learned is that never do this type of thing again, where at least in any way in which the agency's direct\nfingerprints are placed on it. You can pay people. You\ncan subsidize research. You can set up venture capital firms. You got plenty of money. And you can funnel that money\ninto the hands of people who will carry out this\nresearch privately. So if something goes wrong,\nyou have perfect deniability. - On the topic of MICE, on the topic of money, ideology, coercion, and ego, let me ask you about a conspiracy theory. So there is a conspiracy\ntheory that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein. At a high level, if we\ncan just talk about that, is that something that's\nat all even possible? That you have, basically\nthis would be for coercion. You get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous\nand then you collect evidence on them so that you can\nthen have leverage on them. - Well, let's look at\nwhat Epstein was doing. He was a businessman\nwho then also developed a very lucrative sideline and being a high level procurer, basically\nin supplying young girls. And he also filmed much of that activity. I think his partner in this, Ghislaine, and I hope I'm pronouncing\nher name correctly. - I think it's Ghislaine.\n- Ghislaine. Well, I've heard it both ways. Ghislaine or Ghislaine,\nwhichever it may be? I think her argument at\none point was that, well, we did this to protect ourselves. But this type of thing\nhas been done before. There's nothing new about this. Getting influential people\nin compromising situations and filming them. I could give you another\nhistorical example of that. In late 1920, actually early\n1930s, just pre-Nazi Berlin, there was a very prominent\nsort of would-be psychic and occultist by the name\nof Erik Jan Hanussen. He had a private yacht, I think it was called the Seven\nSins, and he hosted parties. He also had a whole club called the Palace of the Occult, which hosted parties where things went on and there were cameras everywhere. He filmed important people, you know, guys like the Brownshirt Chief of Berlin in various states of\nundress and sexual congress. And he did that for the\npurposes of blackmail. So in Epstein's case, he is a procurer of young\ngirls to wealthy men, largely. And many of those events were recorded. Now, even if it wasn't\nhis intention to use them for blackmail, think of\nwhat someone else could do because people know about this. So you can raise a question,\nis this not, you know, Epstein is just kind of a greedy pervert. But through his greedy perversion, he's now collecting information\nthat could be useful. Who could that be useful to? Who would like dirt on Prince Andrew? Think of all the people who were there. There were important people\nwho went to Lolita Island. So if it isn't Epstein\ndirectly, he might have been, I'm not trying to let him off the hook because I have anything for him. He was either running his\nown blackmail business or someone was using\nhim as a front for that. I mean, I think we're\nkidding ourselves if we try to pretend that's not what was going on. - So you think even American\nintelligence agencies would be willing to swoop in and take advantage of a situation like that? - Well, you know, American politicians\ncould ultimately end up in a position to oversee things\nlike intelligence budgets. One of them might even become\ndirector. You never know. You can never tell what some\ncrazy president might do. One of the guys who understood the part was, was J. Edgar Hoover. J. Edgar Hoover spent a long time collecting\ndossiers on politicians. How do you think he'd remain\ndirector of the FBI as long as he did? Because he systematically\ncollected dirt on people. So, there is a history\nof this type of thing. And again, he could argue that's partly for his protection, to keep his job, to protect the sanctity\nand security of the Bureau. You can find a million\ndifferent ways to justify that. - It's really dark. - Well, there is that\nside to human nature. Let's put it that way. - Whether it's the CIA or the Okhrana, maybe that's what the President of the United States sees\nwhen they show up to office is all this stuff they have on him or her. And say, that there's a\ninternal mechanism of power that you don't want to mess with, and so you will listen, whether that internal mechanism of power is the military industrial\ncomplex or whatever, the bureaucracy of government. - Kind of actually the deep state. - The deep state. - The entrenched bureaucrats. Well, it's been said, and I\nthink it's generally true, that bureaucratic creatures\nare like any other creatures, it basically exists to\nperpetuate itself and to grow. I mean, nobody wants\nto go out of business. And of course, you get all of these things like Pizzagate and accusations\nof one form or another. But here's an interesting\nthing to consider. Okay? And I want to argue that I'm\nnot saying that Pizzagate in any way was real or QAnon\nexists, but where do they get these ideas from? So let's ask ourselves,\ndo pedophiles exist? Yeah. Do organized pedophile\norganizations exist? Yeah, they share information, pictures. They're out there on the\ndark web. They cooperate. So does child trafficking\nexist? Yeah, it does. So in other words, whether or not specific\nconspiracy theories about this or that group of\norganized pedophile cultists is real, all the ingredients\nfor that to be real are there. Pedophiles exist, organized\npedophilia exists, child and human trafficking exists. At some point, at some time, someone will put all of those together. In fact, certainly, they already have. - We'll jump around a little bit, but your work is so\nfascinating and it covers so many topics. So let's see if we jump into the present with the Bohemian Grove\nand the Bilderberg Group. - Bilderbergers... - So the elites, as I think\nyou've referred to them. So this gathering of the elites. Can you just talk about\nthem? What is this? - Well, first thing I have to point out is that Bohemian Grove is a\nplace, not an organization. It's where the Bohemian Club meets. It's that 2,700-acre old\ngrowth redwoods near, you know, north of San Francisco. The Bohemian Club began, I\nthink, back in the 1870s. Its initial members\nwere mostly journalists. In fact, supposedly the\nname itself was a term for an itinerant journalist\nwho moved from paper to paper who was called the Bohemian. And although I think\nthere may be other reasons why that particular\nterm was chosen as well, but I think the original five members, there were like three journalists, there was a merchant and there\nwas a vintner guy who owned a vineyards in California, how surprising. None of them terribly wealthy, but they formed an exclusive men's club, was and still is, nothing terribly unusual\nabout that at the time, but it became fashionable. And as it became fashionable, more wealthy people wanted\nto become part of it. And the thing about getting\nrich guys to join your club is what do rich guys have? Money. And of course it's one of those rich guys that bought Bohemian Grove where now you build your\nold boys summer camp, which is what it is. They got cabins with goofy names. They go there, they perform skits, they dress up in costumes. True, some of those skits look\nlike pagan human sacrifices, but it's just a skit. What's really going on there? So on the one hand, you can argue, look, it's a rich guys club. They like to get out there. The whole motto of the place is Weaving Spiders Come Not Here. So we're never gonna talk about business. We just want to get out into\nthe woods, put on some robes, burn a couple of effigies in front of the owl, have a good time,\nprobably get drunk a lot. - What's with the robes? Why do they do weird creepy shit? Why do they put on a mask\nand the robe and do the plays and the owl and the sacrificing? I don't know. - Why do you have a giant owl? I mean, why do you do that? - Well, what is that in human nature? Because I don't think\nrich people are different than not rich people. What is it about wealth and power that brings that out of people? - Well, part of it is\nthe ritual aspect of it. And that clearly is a ritual.\nRituals are pretty simple. Rituals are just a series\nof actions performed in a precise sequence\nto produce an effect. That describes a lot of things. It describes plays, symphonies, every movie you've ever seen. A movie is a ritual. It is a series of actions carried out in a precise sequence\nto produce an effect, but then added soundtrack\nto cue you to what emotions you're supposed to be feeling. - It's a great idea. So the rich people\nshould just go to a movie or maybe just go to a\nTaylor Swift concert. Why do you have to put on\na mask? Why the owl thing? - Part of it is to create\nthis kind of sense, I suppose, of group solidarity. You're all going to appear in... Also a way of sort of\ntranscending yourself in a way. When you put on the robe, it's\nlike putting on a uniform. You are in some way a different\nor a more important person. It's a ritual. The key ritual at Bohemian\nGrove is a thing called the Cremation of Care. And that's what it's supposed to be. We're going to put all of\nour rich, important people, we have to make all of\nthese critical decisions. Life is so hard. So we're going to go out here in the woods and we're going to kick\nback and we're all going to gather around the lake. And then we're going to carry... It's wicker, it's not a real\nperson. And how would you know? And this is the Cremation of our Care. But it's a ritual which is\nmeant to produce a sense of solidarity and relief among\nthose people who are there. The question comes down with the rituals is how seriously do you take them? How important is this to the\npeople who carry them out? And the interesting answer to that is that for some people it's, for some people it's just boring. I mean, there are probably\npeople standing around the owl who think this is\nridiculous and can't wait for it to get over with. There are the people that\nare kind of excited about it and get caught up into it. But other people can\ntake it very seriously. It's all a matter of\nthe intention that you have about what the ritual means. And I don't mean to suggest by that that there's\nanything necessarily sinister about what's going on, but it is clearly a ritual\ncarried out for some kind of group-reinforcing purpose. And you're absolutely right. You don't have to do it that way. I've gone to summer camps and we never carried out mock\nsacrifices in front of an owl. All right? Yeah, we did\nall those other things. We didn't even have any robes either. So it goes beyond merely\na rich guy summer camp, although that's an aspect of it. But it also, I think, often obscures that\nfocusing on Bohemian Grove at the getaway of the\nclub ignores that the club is around all the time. That's what's at the center of this. It is the club and its members. So despite all the talk about no weaving spiders\ncoming around here, one of the other features\nof the summer meeting are things called lakeside talks. Often people are invited to go there. And one of the people who was invited, I think around 1968, was Richard Nixon, who was making his political comeback. And he was invited to give a talk, where very important people are listening. And Nixon, in his memoirs,\nrealized what was going on. He was being auditioned\nas to whether or not he was going to be... He recognized that that\nwas really the beginning of his second presidential campaign. He was being vetted. So one of the main theories, call it a conspiracy theory or not, about the Bohemian Club and\nthe gatherings is that people of wealth and influence gather together. And whether or not it's part of the agenda or not, inevitably you're going to talk\nabout things of interest. But to me, the mere fact that you invite people\nin, political leaders, to give lakeside talks means that there are weaving spiders which are going on. And it is a perfect\nprivate venue to vet people for political office. - I mean, yeah. Where else are you going to do it if you're interested in vetting? If you're interesting in\npowerful people selecting? - Well, see, here's the question. Are these guys actually picking\nwho's going to be president? Is that the decision which is being made? Or are they just deciding what\nhorses they're going to back? I think the latter is the\nsimpler version of it, but it doesn't mean it's\nthe other way around. But these are the kinds of... I mean, Nixon was... There was the whole 1960 thing. So he's the new Nixon. And this is where the\nnew Nixon apparently made a good impression on the right people, because he did indeed get\nthe Republican nomination, and he did indeed become president. Well, there could also be a much more innocent\nexplanation of, really, it's powerful people getting together and having conversations, and through that conversation\ninfluencing each other's view of the world, and just having\na legitimate discussion of policies, foreign policies. - Why wouldn't they? I mean, why would you assume\nthat people are not going to do that? - It's the owl thing with the robes. - Why the owl and why the robes? - Which is why it\nbecomes really compelling when guys like Alex Jones, forgive me, but I've not watched his documentary, I probably should at some point, about the Bohemian Grove, where he claims that there\nis a Satanist human sacrifice of, I think, children. And I think that's quite a\npopular conspiracy theory. Or it has lost popularity, it kind of transformed\nitself into the QAnon set of conspiracy theories. But I mean, can you\nspeak to that conspiracy? - Let's put it this way, to the general public rich\npeople are inherently suspicious. Let's put it that way. First of all, they've got\nall that money and exactly how did one obtain it? And I do not, of necessity, adhere to the view that behind\nevery great fortune there is a great crime, but there often are. There are ways in which it's\nacquired. But I think it's... One of the things I\nthink that can happen is, particularly when people\nacquire a huge amount of money, and I won't name any names, but let's say there are people who perhaps in the tech sphere, who coming from no particular\nbackground of wealth, suddenly find themselves\nwith $600 billion. Well, what? This is the question you would\nhave to ask yourself, why me? Because you're one of the rare, tiny group of human beings\nwho will ever have that kind of wealth in your hands. Even if you are a convinced atheist, I think at some point you\nhave to begin to suspect that the cosmic muffin,\nprovidence, whatever it is, put this money in your hands to do what? Achieve great things. Just\nthink of all the stuff is... So you're gonna start a foundation and you're gonna start backing\nall the things that you like. I think there's an element of ego that comes in with it as well. And again, it may not be so\nmuch what the rich person with a huge amount of\nmoney at their disposal, and a lot of fuzzy ideas about what to do with it can be influenced by others. It's always that question as to who's actually\nmanipulating these events? What's going on in that regard? In some way, they can\nbe a very useful sucker. Find somebody with a lot\nof money and get them to finance the things\nthat you want them to do. The Bohemian Club is, I don't think, in and of itself,\ninherently evil or sinister, but it means that there are\nlots of different people in it who have different agendas. It goes back to what I said\nabout how somebody feels about the Cremation of Care ritual. This is either just a waste of time, it's just some sort of silly\nthing that we're doing, or it is something of great importance, perhaps even mystical\nor religious importance, because that's ostensibly\nwhat it's pretending to be. It's always this question\nas to what degree you begin to play and the play becomes serious. That tends to happen a lot. - You've studied a lot\nof cults and occultism. What do you think is the power\nof that mystical experience? - Well, what is broadly referred to, well, we're getting to, what's occultism? What's the occult? Occult is the hidden, that's all it really means,\nspecifically hidden from sight. And the basis of it is the\nidea that what is hidden? Well, what is hidden from\nus is most of the world, most of reality. So the basic concept within occultism, the basic concept within most religions, which are approved forms of occultism, is that the world, the physical world that we are aware of, is only a very small part\nof a much larger reality. And that what the methods and practices of occultism arguably\ndo is to allow someone to either enter into this\nlarger reality or to access that larger reality for\npurposes to be exploited here. The most interesting statement about, and a key element of this\nbecomes the thing called magic. Now, we all know magic, we know it's a guy standing\non stage performing a trick. But the interesting thing\nabout a stage magician is that a stage magician is... We know when we're watching\nthis that it's a trick. Yet we can't really figure\nout, if he does it well, how that trick is being\naccomplished because it seems to defy physical laws. And that's what's fascinating about it. So even though you know it's a trick, if you can't figure it out, it has this kind of power of fascination, but it's mimicking something. Stage magic is mimicking real magic. So it's real magic. Well, let's go back to Aleister Crowley because, you know, he always has to come. I knew he was gonna come\nup at some point in this, earlier than that, because he always does. - All roads lead to Aleister Crowley. - All roads lead to Aleister Crowley. Aleister Crowley, and\nI've said this enough so I should be able to get it right, but I'm paraphrasing\nhere, he goes, magick, which of course he spelled with a K or CK, is the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will. So in a way that's sort\nof mind over matter, but it's the idea that\none can through will, through intention, bend reality, to make something happen. Somebody wants to put it this way, it's tipping the luck plane. So you got some kind of a level plane. What we're trying to do is\njust tip it just a little bit so the marble rolls over\none side or another. Now that presupposes a lot\nof things that is there a luck plane? I don't know, but it's a good\nsort of idea to have. But... And here again, don't become\noverly bothered trying to figure out whether you\nactually can bend reality. Become bothered by the\nfact that there are people who believe that they can\nand will go to great efforts to do so, and will often\nbelieve they have succeeded. So it's this effort to make things occur in a particular way, maybe just to sort of nudge reality in one\nlittle way or another. And that's where things\nlike rituals come in. Rituals are a way of\nfocusing will and attention. We're all there, we're all\nthinking about the same thing. And you have to imagine just how, the pervasiveness of what\ncould be called that kind of magical thinking every\nday happens everywhere. So let me give you an example. You ever attended a high\nschool football pep rally? Think of what's going on there. Your team is going to\nbattle the other team. You've now assembled\neveryone in the gymnasium. You've got people who are dancing around in animal totem costumes. And what are you chanting? Everyone is supposed to chant\nthat the other team dies, that you will be horribly defeated and that our team will be victorious. That is a magic ritual. The idea is, it becomes into this idea that's very popular about visualizing things,\nvisualizing, manifesting, I love this term. You need to manifest your success. Well, that's just magic. That is trying to cause change\nin conformity with will. So these things can happen without you being even consciously\naware of what's going on. And you don't need to be, because if you're all a part of the mob, which is there in the\ngymnasium and you get into this and you get worked up, and a cultist would\nargue what you're doing is you're creating a\nhuge amount of energy. All of these people are\nputting energy into something and that energy goes somewhere. And maybe you can, maybe, just maybe you actually can\nslightly increase the chances of your team's victory. Of course, your opponents\nare having their own ritual at the same time. So whoever has the bigger\nmojo will apparently win on the team. - So that's a, I would say,\ntrivial example of that, but a clear one. But I do believe that there's\nincredible power in groups of humans getting together\nand morphing reality. I think that's probably one of the things that made human civilization what it is. Groups of people being\nable to believe a thing and bring that belief into reality. - Yes, that's, you're exactly right. Trying to conceive of something and then through intention, will, to\nmanifest that into this realm. - And of course, that power of the collective\nmind can be leveraged by charismatic leaders\nto do all kinds of stuff, whether you get cults that do\nhorrible things, or anything. - There might be a cult\nthat does good things. I don't know. It depends. We don't call those cults. - Exactly. 100%. - Without endorsing this entirely. An interesting, one of the questions, what's the difference between\na cult and a religion? And it has been said, that\nin the case of a cult, there's always someone\nat the top who knows what's going on, generally,\nwho knows it's a scam. In a religion, that person is dead. So, see, I've just managed to\ninsult every single religion. But it's an interesting\nway of thinking about it because I think there is\nsome degree of accuracy in that statement. - Do you think actually the interesting psychological\nquestion is, in cults, do you think the person\nat the top always knows that it's a scam? Do you think there's\nsomething about the human mind where you gradually- - Begin to believe your own bullshit? Yes, that again is part of magic, I think, is believing your own bullshit. It doesn't necessarily mean that the head of the cult realized, but\nthere's someone, maybe the second, you know, I always sort of look in the lieutenants, someone probably has an\nidea about what's going on. The other thing that seems\nto be a kind of dead giveaway for what we would call a cult is what's called excessive\nreverence for the leader. People just believe\neverything these people say. I give you an example of the first time I ever encountered anything\nlike that was in... Was in Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia in the 1970s. I was going to grad school and there was a particular cult locally, which I think was Brotherhood of the Sun. And I noticed the same, so\nthere was some guy who was, you know, among the other things, followers were convinced to\nhand over all their money and personal belongings to him. I believe he used part of that\nmoney to buy a yacht with. Anyway, a lot of it went to him. And then of course, working for free upon\ndifferent cult-owned business enterprises of which there were several. And there was a person I knew who became a devoted follower of this, and it was, all I could think of at\none point was ask them, what the hell is the matter with you? I mean, have you lost your\nmind? Why would you... What is it that this person\ncan possibly be providing that you essentially are\ngoing to become a slave to them, which is what they were doing? And I actually give that\ncredit in a way of sort of sparking my whole interest in things like secret societies. And here again, as a disclaimer, I am not now nor have I ever been a member of any fraternal organization, secret society or cult that I know of. And that's what interests me about them, because I'm just always\ntrying to figure out why people do these things. Like I said, why the\nrobes and the owl? Why? Why do you do that? And it's\ntrying to figure it out. I mean, I couldn't even\nhack the boy scouts. Okay, that was too much of that. Because to me, you join an organization and the first thing that comes along is there's somebody, there\nare rules and someone is telling you what to do. Okay. I don't like people\ntelling me what to do. Spent much of my life trying to avoid that as much as possible. And join a cult, there's gonna be someone\ntelling you what to do. Join the Bohemian Club and there's gonna be someone\ntelling you what to do. And obviously, a lot of people really get\nsomething out of that. It becomes, in some ways, it's sort of necessary\nfor them to function. But I do not understand\nit and my study of it is a personal effort to try to understand why people do that. - And there's so many reasons. Primary of which I would say is the desire in the human heart to belong. - Yes. - And the dark forms that it takes throughout human history,\nrecent human history, is something I'd love to\ntalk to you a bit about. If we can go back to the\nbeginning of the 20th century, on the German side, you've described how secret\nsocieties like The Thule Society laid the foundation for Nazi ideology. Can you, through that lens,\nfrom that perspective, describe the rise of the Nazi party? - Well, I guess we could start with, what on earth is The Thule Society? So The Thule Society was a\nsmall German occult society. That is, they studied metaphysics, their fancy word for occultism. That appeared in Munich around 1917, 1918. The key figure behind it\nwas a German esotericist by the name of Rudolf von Sebottendorff. Okay, not his real name. His real name was Adam Rudolf Glauer. He was adopted by a\nGerman nobleman and got the name von Sebottendorff. And I like to say that name. So I have this real thing about vague, mysterious characters who\nshow up and do things. And trying to figure out\nwho these people are. So we're working with\nthe years sort of prior to the First World War. So the decade or so prior to World War I, he spends a lot of time\nin the Ottoman Empire. Turkey, there was in the Ottoman Empire, which was a fairly tumultuous place because in 1908 and 1909, there was the Young Turk Revolution. And you had a kind of military coup, which effectively overthrew\nthe Ottoman Sultan and installed a military junta, which would go on during\nthe First World War to make its greatest achievement\nin the Armenian genocide. Eventually, it created a\ngenocidal military regime, which would lead the country into disastrous First World War, which would destroy the Ottoman Empire, out of which modern Turkey emerges. Yada, yada, yada. - And by the way, we should\ntake a tiny tangent here, which is that you refer to\nthe intelligence agencies as being exceptionally successful. And here in the case of the Young Turks being\nalso very successful in doing the genocide, meaning they've achieved the greatest impact, even\nthough the impact on the scale of good to evil tends towards evil. It's one of those things\nthat often comes out of revolutionary situations. Revolutions always seek to\nmake things better, don't they? We're going to take a bad old regime. You know, the Sultan is, you\nknow, and the Sultan was bad. I think it's fairly stated. Abdul Hamid II wasn't called a Red Sultan because of his favorite\ncolor type of thing. And the idea is that they\nwere going to improve, they were now going to, the Ottoman Empire was a\nmultinational empire... They were going to try\nto equalize and bring in the different groups. And none of that\nhappened. It became worse. Okay? In the same way that you\ncould argue that the goal of Russian revolutionaries was to get rid of the bad old incompetent\nmedieval czarist regime and to bring in a new\ngreat shining future, and it became even more authoritarian. And the crimes of the\nImperial Russian regime pale the significance of what\nwould follow in the same way that the crimes of Abdul\nHamid pale when you get to the Young Turks. But that wasn't necessarily the intention. But von Sebottendorff\nwas a German businessman who's working in this period. And the whole point here\nis that the Ottoman Empire in this period is a hotbed\nof political intrigue. And all kinds of\ninteresting things about it. The Young Turk revolution is essentially a military coup, but it is\nplotted in Masonic lodges. Okay, I know, technically Masonic lodges are never supposed to be involved\nin politics, but they are. Or, the lodge meeting breaks up and then you plot the revolution. So, same group of people,\nbut it's not technically. But yes, and there's the\nMacedonia Risorta Lodge in Thessaloniki was\nground zero for plotting this military coup that was\nsupposed to improve the empire. Sebottendorff is in one way\nor another mixed up in all of this, or at least he's an\nobserver, plus he's initiated, he's initiated into the Masonic lodges. And interestingly enough,\nthe fellow who initiates him into one of these Eastern\nlodges is a Jewish merchant by the name of Termudi. And who's also a Kabbalist. And also... So, Sebottendorff is very,\nvery interested in the occult. He's initiated into Eastern\nMasonic lodges in a period when those same lodges\nare being used as a center for political intrigue. He also apparently is\ninvolved in gun running, which in revolutionary periods is, there's a lot of money\nto be made off of that. So, he's connected to\nvarious dark businesses in a tumultuous time, with connections to politicized\nFreemasonry and the occult. Now, in the course of the First World War, he returns to Germany. He just shows up. And It would be my operative\nsuspicion or theory that Sebottendorff was\nworking for someone. I don't think he just pops up\nin Munich on his own accord. Why does he leave the\nOttoman Empire and return to that place? Who's behind him? Maybe no one, but maybe someone, because he does seem to\nhave money at his disposal. And he comes into Munich\nand he basically takes over this small sort\nof occult study group. Now the interesting thing\nis that The Thule Society is really just a branch of\nanother existing what's called an Ariosophist order, a\nthing called the German order or the Germanenorden, which\nis centered in Berlin. But for some reason, he doesn't want his group\nto be connected by name with the Germanenorden. So Thule Society, Thule in\nthis case is a reference to supposedly a mythical Arctic\nhomeland of the Aryan race. Apparently, they're all\nsnow people who wander out of the snow at some point. It's kind of like a frozen Atlantis. So I mentioned these\npeople, the Ariosophists, who, you have to practice\nsaying that, so what are they? Well, they're a kind of racist, Germanic offshoot of theosophy. And I know I'm explaining one thing to explain something, but\nthere's no other way to do this. So theosophy was 19th century, very popular and widely\nmodeled occult belief that was founded by a\nRussian woman by the name of Helena Blavatsky. She was a medium psychic. She supposedly got channelings\nfrom the ascended masters. The basic story there, they're all of the ascended masters, which are mystical beings\nthat may or may not have once been human. They live inside the Himalayas\nor they float among them on a cloud and they guide the spiritual\nevolution of humanity. What Blavatsky did was to\ntake Western esotericism and blend it with Hindu\nand Buddhist esotericism, which became very, very sexy in the West. Still is. Buddhism attracts a lot of people because, well, it's Buddhism. It's different, see? So the Mahatmas, the ascended masters were\nsending her messages, despite the fact that she\nwas later proven pretty much to be a fraud and writing\nthe letters herself. Nevertheless, people still went along with this doctrine, and\nit's been widely modified and copied since then. So an idea in theosophy was that human spiritual\nevolution was tied to physical evolution. So in the case of Blavatsky, Blavatsky never said that\nAryans, white people, anything out this were superior. She talked about the different root races, but it's just, her version of it, it's just total gobbledygook\nthat seems to include everyone. I defy you to make much sense out of it. But in the early 20th century,\nthere were different sort of, one of the things that became fashionable, not terribly popular,\nthese are small movements with the idea that, well, Germany\nis a new upcoming country. And part of this, I think, was really trying to define who the Germans were, because, remember, the German empire, Germany as a political state doesn't\ncome into existence until 1871. Prior to that, Germany was\na geographic expression, a vague one which described a large area in Central\nEurope where a lot of people who wore leather shorts and, or something like that and\nspoke similar German dialects, were nominally Germans, but they might be\nPrussians or Bavarians... They came in all sorts of\nvarieties and relations. There was no German identity. Something very similar happened\nin Italy in the same period. There weren't Italians. There were Sardinians\nand there were Romans and there were Sicilians,\nUmbrians, spoke, again, dialects of a similar\nlanguage, but it never lived, not since the Roman Empire\nunder a single state and really didn't think\nof themselves as the same. So you have to create\nthis artificial thing. You have to create Germans. There's now a Germany with an emperor, and so we're all going to be Germans. Well, exactly what is that? Much of it is an artificial creation. You have to decide upon some\nsort of standard dialect. Okay, we'll decide what that is. Often a dialect that only a\nfew people actually speak, and then they will be\ndrilled into children's heads through state schooling programs. So I think this is the kind of\nmilieu that it comes out of. People were trying to figure out what on Earth Germans actually were. And the need for some\nsort of common identity. And, you know, that leads to everything like Wagnerian opera. Richard Wagner wanted to\ncreate a German mythical music. So he went back and strip\nmined old German myths and cobbled them together\ninto a lot of people standing on stage singing. And that was his purpose.\nHe was a nationalist. He was in many ways a kind\nof racialist nationalist. And this was his idea of\ntrying to create out of bits and pieces of the past a\nnewfangled form of German identity. So, on the more mystical end of this, you had the ideas that, well, Germany must have been created for some special purpose because the Germans must\nbe very special people. And we must have some sort\nof particular destiny. And then out of this, you know, the direction this is heading, well, we're all part of some sort\nof master race with some sort of ties to some sort of great\ncivilization in the past, call it Thule, call it\nwhatever you want to be. They basically just invent things. And try to attach those to the past. And so Ariosophy was the\nAryanized version of theosophy. And what this did was to take the idea that spiritual and\nphysical evolution had led to the most advanced form of human beings, which were the Aryans and\nthe most advanced group of them were, of course, the Germans. And this attracted appeal. Keep in mind again, this\nwas not a mass movement. This is very much a fringe movement. Most people weren't aware of it and weren't particularly interested in it, but it had appeal for those\nwho already had a kind of esoteric bent in some form or another. And this is where things\nlike the Germanenorden, the German order and\nthere are other groups, it was only one of many,\nsort of grew out of. And what it was that The\nThule Society as a branch, The Thule Gesellschaft was\nsupposed to do was to study this. It was an esoteric study group. And so people would get\ntogether and they'd talk about things, probably make\nmore stuff up and all sort of work around this idea of German Aryans is the most advanced type\nof human beings and all the wonderful things that\nthe future would hold. And the fact that this\nwas in the midst of a war in which Germany was, again,\nfighting, as they saw it, for its existence, heightened those kinds of tensions as well. So my suspicion, again, is that Sebottendorff in\nterms of who was behind him, that he was essentially\ncalled back to Germany to work either for the\nPrussian political police or for some aspect of German\nintelligence or security to try to mobilize\noccultism or esotericism for the war effort. Because again, this is 1918, the war has gone on way too long. Within a few months,\nGermany will collapse, and it will collapse simply from the psychological\nexhaustion of the population. So this is almost like to help\nthe war effort with a kind of propaganda, a narrative\nthat can strengthen the will of the German people. - It would strengthen\nthe will of some people. You have to try to appeal to\ndifferent aspects of this. But the mystical aspect\nis one of those things that can be, can have a\nvery powerful influence. And the idea is that we\ncan come up with some kind of mystical nationalism. Maybe that's one to put it, a kind of mystical nationalism that can be exploited for the... At this point, you're kind\nof grasping at straws. And this is a whole\nperiod when the Germans are marshaling the last\nof their forces to launch a series of offensives\non the Western Front, the Peace Offensive, which\nwill initially be successful but will ultimately fail and\nlead to a collapse in morale. But among the leadership of\nGermany, it was a recognition, it was that national morale was flagging. And one of the other things that was kind of raising its head was\nwhat had happened nearby a year, well, the Russian Revolution, which had now brought the idea\nof another solution to all of this, the idea of\nrevolutionary Marxism. Here we need to remind ourselves as to where Marxism comes\nfrom, not Russia, Germany. Where was the largest\nMarxist party? In Germany. - And Marx probably expected the revolution to begin in Germany. - Where else? - I mean, the Soviet Union\nis not very industrialized. Germany is, and so that's\nwhere it would probably be. - Russia, 5% of the population\nis industrial workers. In Germany, 40% of the population is... So if any place was made\nfor Marxism, it was Germany. I think that's why it\ncaught on in East Germany so well, because it did kind of come home. It was a local belief. It wasn't something\nimported by the Russians. It was a German invention. So... The Thule Society, one\nof the things you can see in this is The Thule Society\nwas particularly involved in sort of anti-Marxist or\nanti-Bolshevik agitation. They saw themselves, saw\nthem as this whole movement. It was a counter to this. It was a kind of counter-Marxist movement. - Can we sort of try to break\nthat apart in a nuanced way? So it was a nationalist movement. The occult was part of the\npicture, occult racial theories. So there's a racial component,\nlike the Aryan race. So it's not just the nation of Germany. And you take that and\ncontrast it with Marxism. Did they also formulate\nthat in racial terms? Did they formulate that in\nnational versus global terms? Like how do they see this? - Marxism formulates everything by class. People are categorized by class. You're either part of the\nproletariat or you're part of the bourgeoisie or just, you know, you're either part of the proletariat or\njust some sort of scum. Really, needs to be swept\ninto the dustbin of history. Only workers count. And that was what would take someone who was a nationalist, would sort of drive them\ncrazy because their idea is we're trying to create a German people. We're trying to create a\ncommon German identity. But what the Marxists are doing is they're dividing Germans\nagainst each other by class. German workers hate\nthe German bourgeoisie. German proletariat is opposed\nto German capitalists. We're all trying to\nfight this war together. So that was why Marxism, particularly in the form of Bolsheism, was seen as unpatriotic. And of course, it was opposed\nto the war as a whole. The idea that parroting\nLenin was that the war was an imperialist war. And the only thing that\nwas good that was going to come out of it is that the\nimperialist war through all of the crises it was creating\nwould eventually lead to a class war. And that would be good because\nthat would reconcile all of these things. But think of this, the two\nvery different versions of this, the Bolshevist\nversion or let's just call it the Marxist version of Germany, it was going to be a class\nsociety in which we're going to have to have some\nkind of civil upheaval, which will have Germans fighting Germans. Whereas the kind of mystical nationalism, the almost kind of religious nationalism that Sebottendorff and The Thule Society had hitched its wagon to held\nthat Germans are all part of a single racial family\nand that's what must be the most important thing. And that these can be\ndifferent ways of trying to influence people. It comes down to a matter\nof political influence. So in a sense, I think that what Sebottendorff\nand The Thule Society was trying to do, at least within Munich, was to use this idea\nof mystical nationalism as a potential rallying\npoint for some part of the population to\noppose these other forces, to keep people fighting. The war is lost though,\nby the, in November, the Kaiser abdicates and essentially the socialists do take over in Germany. Things come very, very close\nto following the Russian model. And you even get the\nRussian version or take on the Bolsheviks, which\nare the Spartacists who try and fail to seize power early on. But you do essentially end\nup with a socialist Germany. And that then leaves in\nthe aftermath of the war, The Thule Society is\nsort of the odd man out, although they're still very\nclosely connected to the army. Now here's one of the things\nthat I find interesting. When you get into 1919, who is it that's paying\nSebottendorff's bills? It's the army. The one thing the German\narmy is absolutely determined to do is to preserve its\nsocial position and power. And they're perfectly willing\nto dump the Kaiser to do that. That's sort of this deal which is made. In November of 1918, Kaiser's abdication, the proclamation of a German Republic, which you just had this guy declare it, it wasn't really planned. There's the Ebert-Groener pact. Groener is the chief of staff,\ngeneral staff at this point. Friedrich Ebert is the\nchief socialist politician, basically, and they make an agreement. And the agreement basically is that the army will\nsupport Ebert's government, if Ebert supports the army. And particularly that\nmeans the continuation of the officer corps and the general staff\nin one form or another. So a deal is made. And that of course is what\nwill eventually help defeat the Spartacist uprising. - Now was the army doing\nthe similar kinds of things that we've talked about with\nthe intelligence agencies, this kind of same kind of trying to control\nthe direction of power? - Well, the German intelligence landscape in the First World War\nis obscure in many ways. There are lots of things that\nare going on. You've got... Germany has a military intelligence\nservice called Abteilung or Section III b. That's just plain military intelligence. They're constantly trying to collect military\ninformation before the war about the weaponry and plans\nof the enemies and then about what the operational\nplans were during the war. It doesn't really go\nmuch beyond that though. The German foreign office runs a kind of political intelligence service. And that's the one which\nis much more involved in things like subsidizing\nsubversion in Russia, which is one of the things\nthat the Germans sign on to fairly early. Little diversion here, in 1915 there is a Russian revolutionary\nwho's lived much of his life in Germany who goes by\nthe code name of Parvus. And he essentially comes to the Germans in Constantinople,\ninteresting enough, in Turkey. He's hanging around there the\nsame time as Sebottendorff is there, which I find curious. So Parvus or Alexander Helphand, to give his actual\nname, comes and he goes, look, there's a lot of\nrevolutionaries in Russia and there's a lot of\nmistrust with the regime. We think that the war will\nincrease the contradictions in Russian society. And if you give me a lot of marks, I can finance this revolutionary activity, and through subversion, I can\ntake Russia out of the war. Well, the Germans are\nfacing a two front war. That sounds great. We'll\nuse money in order to... But notice what they're doing. The German general staff, a very conservative organization, not a bunch of revolutionaries, are going to finance revolution\nin an opposing country. They are going to finance\nrevolutionary subversion to take Russia out of the\nwar, which basically works. So that gives you another idea as to what the German\nmilitary is willing to do. They're not revolutionaries, but they'll pay revolutionaries\nto subvert another regime. Now you've got the problem is that the revolutionary regime that your money helped bring\nto power is now threatening to extend into your country. So the whole question for\nthe army and for others in Germany in 1919 is how to keep Germany from going Bolshevik, from, in a sense, being hoist by your own petard. So The Thule Society, I don't think is a huge\npart of this program, but it is a part of it. And it's all an effort\nto try to keep control. And that's why the army is financing them. That's even why the army at some point then supplies\nthem with its own propagandists. So The Thule Society begins to create under Sebottendorff's\nleadership, what he called the rings of Thule. And these are satellite organizations\nthat aren't the society as though, but they're kind of controlled and inspired by it. And one of those is a thing called the German Workers' Party. And the German Workers'\nParty, again, is local. It's not large. It's not\nterribly influential. But what does it aspire to be? It aspires to be a party that will bring German workers away from the seductive\ninfluence of the Bolsheviks and into a more patriotic\nposition, a patriot... And the way that I describe\nthis is that it's not an anti-communist organization, it's a counter-communist organization. So you don't create something which completely opposes it, you create something which mimics it, which is ultimately what the German Workers' Party will become is the National Socialist\nGerman Workers' Party. Notice that term, socialist. And that is, in my view, what Nazism is from the beginning. It is a counter-communist movement. - And by the way, for\npeople who don't know, the National Socialist\nGerman Workers' Party is also known as the Nazi Party. So how did this evolution\nhappen from those, that complicated little interplay? We should also say that\na guy named Adolf Hitler is in the army at this time. - Yes. - Well... - He's going to come into this. Because remember, the army was going to supply its own propagandists to help the German Workers' Party and The Thule Society do their work. And the propagandist they\nsupply them with is a man who the army trains, sends to classes to learn the art of public\nspeaking and propaganda. And that fellow is Corporal Adolf Hitler. - So how does Adolf Hitler connect with the German Workers' Party? - Well, he'd been in\nthe army during the war, the only regular job that he'd ever had. Kind of liked it. So you often get the view is that, well, at the end of the war, he joined millions of other German soldiers\nwho didn't have jobs. No, no, he stays in the army. He stays in the army until 1921. He's on the army payroll at the very time in which he is able to\nhelp them to set this up. What appears to have happened is this. Sebottendorff had organized\nThe Thule Society. That didn't have, you know,\nthat it had tried to oppose... There's actually a brief period of time in which the communists\nactually take over Munich, the Bavarian Soviet Republic,\nwhich doesn't last very long. And eventually the army and\nvolunteers put this down. While that's going on, by the way, Hitler is actually sitting in the barracks in Munich wearing a red armband because he is technically\npart of the soldiers who have gone over to the\nBavarian Soviet Republic. He seems to have had flexible\ninterests in this case. So once order is restored, so to speak, the army comes in and decide that, well, one of the things we need, we need to have people\nwho can lecture soldiers on patriotic topics. So there is a particular\ncaptain by the name of Karl Mayr who sort of spots Hitler. He later describes him as\nlike a stray dog looking for a master. Hitler has a knack for public speaking. Other soldiers will listen to\nhim. Some people can do that. Some people can't. Mayr decides that he's a good candidate for further training. So yes, they bring him in. They turn him into a\nwhat's called a Wehmann, a kind of liaison man. He's an army propagandist. And then you've got this\nlittle outfit called the German Workers' Party. And essentially what happens\nis that Hitler is sent in to take over leadership of\nthat, which is what happens. He shows up, he attends a meeting. There are like 50 people there. By the way, the topic of\nthe first meeting he's at is how and why capitalism\nshould be abolished, which is not what you might well expect. Because remember, the German\nWorkers' Party is trying to cast itself as a counter-Bolshevism. So it's not saying that\ncapitalism is great, which is important. No, capitalism is evil,\nwe agree upon that. We just agree it has to be destroyed from a nationalist\npoint of view as opposed from some sort of strange\ninternationalist point of view. So Hitler is essentially, as I see it, sent in by the army as their trained man to assume leadership\nwithin this small party and to use it for the army's\npatriotic propaganda campaign. And it's a season doing so. Even to the name change to the National Socialist\nor German Workers' Party? I mean, really, what\nsounds more red than that? - So the interesting thing here is from where did anti-Semitism\nseep into this whole thing? It seems like the way they try to formulate counter-Marxism\nis by saying the problem with capitalism and the\nproblem with Marxism is that it's really\nJudeo-capitalism and, quote, Judeo-Bolshevism. From where did that ideology seep in? - Well, that's a huge topic. Where does anti-Semitism come from? Let's start with that term itself, a term which I have\nreally grown increasingly to dislike, because it doesn't\nactually say what it means. Anti-Semitism is anti-Jewism.\nThat's all it is. I'm not sure whether there\nhas ever existed a person who hated Jews, Arabs,\nand Maltese equally. Okay, that's kind of hard to imagine. But that's technically\nwhat that would mean because let's face it,\nmost Semites are Arabs. So if you're an anti-Semite, then you don't seem to\ndistinguish Jews from Arabs. It makes no sense. The origin of the term is invented by,\nguess what, an anti-Semite. A guy in the 1870s, a German journalist by\nthe name of Wilhelm Marr, who is, wouldn't you know\nit, part Jewish himself, and who decides that you\nreally need a better term than Judenhass, Jew hate, which was the term\nbecause that just sounds so inelegant, doesn't it? Okay. What do you want to call yourself? A Jew hater or an anti-Semite? See, anti-Semitism, it's got\nthat -ism part at the end of it, which means it's\na system of belief. Anything that has an -ism must somehow be\nscientific and important. It's all part of the 19th\ncentury obsession with trying to bring science into\nsomething on one or the other. So we're going to get rid\nof Jew hate and we're going to turn it into anti-Semitism. And we're only going to\nbe talking about Jews, but we'll never actually say that. Somehow, the invention of\na Jew hater to disguise the fact that he's a Jew hater, even though he's partly Jewish, by inventing the term anti-Semitism worked because everybody has bought\nit and repeated it ever since. So... I don't know. Maybe just because\nanti-Jewism would just be, is it too direct in some way? Do we have difficulty\nconfronting actually what it is that we're talking about? - I do wish terms were a little bit more direct\nand self-explanatory. Yeah. Jew hate is a better term. - Well, the question then comes, what exactly do you hate about Jews? And a lot of this has to do with, if you go back prior to the 19th century, if Jews were hated, they were\nhated for religious reasons. In Christian Europe, they're hated because they weren't Christians. And they existed as the only kind of significant religious minority. But other than that, they\ntended to live separately. They had little economic influence. Jews tended to live in shtetls in the east, ghettos elsewhere. They were, some were involved in banking and business, but they\nsort of remained segregated from much of society. That changes when you\nget to the 19th century and with what's called\nJewish emancipation. And that means that between\nabout 1800 and 1850, most European countries\ndrop the various legal or social restrictions against Jews. They are assimilated\ninto the general society. So ideally you stop being\na German Jew and you become a Jewish German. Those are two very different\nimportant concepts. And what that does of\ncourse is that it opens up the professions, business\nworld, elsewhere. So Jews move, who had been\nlargely within those realms to begin with, they already\nhad a good deal of experience in banking and business, and they move into those\nareas and professions and become quite visible. And that's what then creates antisemitism. Because in some way that is seen as part of the changes that have taken place. And there are a lot of\nthings going on here. Part of it has to do with\nthe kind of wrenching social and economic changes that took\nplace with industrialization. So one of the things to keep in mind is that in the process\nof industrialization, just like today, whole classes of people were made extinct economically. Craftsmen, for instance. So when factories came along and began to produce things with machines, all the craftspeople who had made those things\npreviously are now unemployed or go to work as wage labor in factories. So there are winners and\nlosers in industrialization. And what people saw in\nGermany and elsewhere is that among this new sort\nof rising capitalist elite, among these new professions, among the bureaucrats that are coming out of these burgeoning states, there were visibly a fair number of Jews. So in some way, the rise of Jews in the minds of many people were connected to all of the other bad things\nthat were going on. The world was changing\nin a way we don't like. And seemingly, the Jews are\nprospering while I am not. And that was true in\nGermany and elsewhere. Jews became highly visible\nin the professions. They became very visible in banking. They became visible in legal profession. They became visible in\nthe medical profession. And those are people that\na lot of people would come in contact with, bankers,\nlawyers, and doctors. They were not the majority there, but vastly over-represented in terms of the general population, and\nespecially within the cities. So in that sense, the roots of anti-Semitism\nto me is that Jews in Germany and elsewhere, and not just in Germany by any means, France,\nBritain, everywhere else, became identified with the bad changes that were taking place. But you also found that Jews were not only prominent among capitalists, they were also prominent among, in the socialist movement as well. So one of the things\nyou could look around, we return to Germany in\n1919 in the aftermath of World War I, and you\nlook around in Bavaria or elsewhere, you tend to\nfind that there are a lot of Jews in visible positions\non the German left. Rosa Luxemburg is but one example of that. Eugen Levine, some of\nthem came in from Russia. When the Soviets send a\nrepresentative to Germany in this period, it's Karl Radek, a Jew. So it wasn't difficult to\nexploit that to argue that just as the ranks of capitalism\nwas full of Jews, the ranks of Bolshevism or of the revolutionary\nleft were full of Jews because you could easily\ngo around and distinguish a great many of them. Again, they don't have to be the majority, they just have to be numerous,\nprominent, and visible, which they were. So this provided you a, you know, in case of the propaganda\nof the German army, the type of stuff that Hitler spewed out, they could put all the\nanti-capitalist rhetoric in there wanted to. The army was never going\nto overthrow capitalism, and the capitalists knew\nthey weren't going to do it. So go ahead, you know, talk shit about us. We don't really care. That's not going to, because we know that\nthe army would prevent that from happening. The way to then undermine\nthe real enemy, it was seen, the revolutionary left was to point out the Jewish influence there. I mean, look at Russia. Well,\nLenin's not, but Trotsky. There he is. Look, there's a Jew. There's one. Radek is a Jew. It wasn't hard to find\nthem in that regard. - You gave a lecture on \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" It's widely considered to\nbe the most influential work of anti-Semitism ever, perhaps. Can you describe this text? - Well, \"The Protocols of\nthe Learned Elders of Zion\" is probably one of the most troublesome and destructive works of\nliterature that has ever emerged. And yet its origins remain obscure. So you get a whole variety of stories about where it came from. So the one story that is\noften is that it was the work of the Okhrana, the Russian secret police, and in particular, it was\nall crafted in 1904 and 1905. In Paris, there's a whole description of Pyotr Rachkovsky, who\nwas supposedly the chief of the Okhrana at the time,\nwas the man behind it. Another fellow by the\nname of Matvei Golovinsky was the drafter of it. And that they had this document written by a French political writer from some decades back\ncalled \"Dialogue on Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu,\" which they were then adapting... Usually it's argued\nthat they plagiarized it into the protocols. And none of that is really true. I mean, the first part\nabout it is that at the time this supposedly took place, Rachkovsky wasn't working for the Okhrana. He'd been fired and he wasn't in Paris. And the whole situation\nwhich is described couldn't have taken place because the people who did it weren't there. It's a story. But it provides\na kind of explanation for it. So \"The Protocols\" emerge. So\nyou always have to go back. This is one of the things that\nI have found always useful in research is go back to the beginning. Find the first place this is mentioned or the first version\nor the first iteration. Where does it start? So you go back to St.\nPetersburg, Russia, around 1903. There is a small right-wing\nanti-Semitic newspaper published there called Znamya, Banner. And it publishes in a kind of serial form a work doesn't credit\nwith any original author. And this is the first version of \"The Protocols of the\nLearned Elders of Zion.\" But what it's actually describing\nis a Judeo-Masonic plot to rule the world. Those two terms are\nalways combined together. And I think in the earlier version, there's far more mentions of\nFreemasons than there are Jews. The publisher of Znamya\nis closely connected to a thing called the Union\nof the Russian People, the Union of Russian Men, which ostensibly existed\nto defend the empire against subversion, and particularly against what it thought\nwas Jewish subversion, when they also argued that\nthe prominence of Jews in revolutionary movements somehow proved that this was in some\nway a Jewish revolution. But again, this is not\na mainstream newspaper, it's not appealing to a\nmainstream population, very few people saw it, but\nthis is where it appears. Now keep in mind, that's two or three years\nbefore it's usually said to have been written. Or the other version is that\nthere's this crazy priest by the name of Sergei\nNilus, and he wrote it, or actually appended it as an\nappendix to his work in 1905. Now, it was around before that. So Nilus didn't create it, it wasn't drafted in\nParis in 1904 and 1905. It was serialized in an obscure right-wing\nRussian newspaper, 1903. - And by the way, we should say\nthat these are 24 protocols. - Well, it varies. - It varies. That are, I guess, supposed to be like meeting notes about the supposed cabal\nwhere the Jews and Freemasons are planning together a world domination. But it's like meeting notes, right? - Protocol, which are Russian\nterms basically for notes of a meeting.\n- Yeah. - Well, as notes of a meeting, these are the goofiest\nthings I've ever seen. Because what you've got\nhere, it's not notes. No one takes notes from\na meeting that way. What you've got is like the exposition of a Bond villain, right? It's all of this, \"Boy, all\nof them are gonna do this!\" And then, the last thing you\nwant to do is lay out your, if you've got a plan for world domination, my suggestion would be,\ndon't write it down. So it's not notes of a meeting. Again, it's another sort\nof narrative or story that's being told. It bears no resemblance\nto the \"Dialogue in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.\" But what it is, the best thing, it's not particularly\nreadable in some ways. There was an Italian writer, and they know Cesare Michelis, who wrote a book translated in English called \"The Non-Existent Manuscript.\" And what it is is that he takes the different versions\nstarting with the 1902, 1903 versions and looks\nthrough the other ones. And he tries to in the\nprocess to reconstruct what he thinks the\noriginal might have been. But the other thing he does,\nwhich was fascinating to me, is that he takes this\nwhole sort of initial text. And in bold type, he\nindicates the paragraphs, but more often sentences\nor phrases that appear to be identical from the Joly work. And they're just scattered throughout it. There's no particular\nrhyme or reason to it. You don't plagiarize that\nway. I mean, who does that? It's a sentence here, a sentence there... Which has led to a\npeculiar theory of mine, which of course I will\nhave to expound upon, which is that I think\nthat the original author of \"The Protocols\" was\nthe same Maurice Joly. I think what someone\nstumbled across was a work which he wrote and never\npublished and which he just drew. It's exactly what someone would do working from your own kind of material. Because I've written things and then taken what I've written and\nthen sort of repackaged that into something else. - A sentence here, a sentence there... - And the same sort of thing comes out. Only sort of bits and pieces of it remain. So why would Joly have done that? Joly was, we're talking about a man whose career basically spanned the 1850s to 1870s. He's an obscure figure. I'm not even totally sure he existed. I mean, it's one of those\nthings you go looking for him. - I love that you're a scholar\nof people that just kind of emerge out of the darkness. - They just come from nowhere. - And there's the Okhrana of there also. And we should also say this was, I guess the original would be written... I mean, what's the language\nof the original? Russian? - Russian. But my hunch is that that's\nadopted from a French version. First of all, they're constantly harping on Freemasons, which wasn't nearly as a big idea as it is there. If you go back to France in the 1890s, there's some big scandals. Well, there's the Dreyfus\nscandal. Well, we got that. All right. Where you've got a Jewish officer on trial\nfor being a traitor. All right? So that was, so you're bringing\nthe whole Jewish element, Jews as disloyal, Dreyfus case, 1894. Earlier, you had the Panama scandal, which was this huge investment scandal when the Panama Canal\nCompany in Paris collapsed. And again, many of the\nmajor players in that work, Jewish financiers. And then you've got the Taxil hoax. So the Taxil hoax was\nthe work of this guy. His real name was I think, Jogand-Pagès. He was kind of a French journalist. He started out writing porn. So when he wrote things like\n\"Sex Lives of the Popes\" and \"The Erotic Bible\" and\nvarious things of that kind, he was a Catholic, broke\nwith the Catholic Church, wrote bad stuff about the Popes, and apparently became a\nFreemason for a while... And then supposedly\nrecanted his evil ways, went back to the church. And then under the name Leo\nTaxil began writing these whole series of articles,\nbasically arguing that there was a Masonic satanic\nconspiracy, run by the way, by an American, Albert Pike. And this also included child sacrifice, it's got Pizzagate as well, by a high\npriestess, Diana Vaughan. And so there's like\nchild sacrifice, weird, robe-y Bohemian Grove stuff. And the Freemasons are\ndevil worshipers going back to the Knights Templars. And so there's a thing called \"The Devil in the Nineteenth Century\" and \"The Secrets of Freemasonry.\" And this became a bestseller in France. So France is just obsessed with all these kinds of conspiracy. So evil satanic Freemasons,\nevil Jewish financiers, Dreyfus... Yes, this is the brew\nwhere all of this comes. I want to figure out how Freemasons and Jews get connected together? France is the place where this happens. Now, Taxil or Jogand-Pagès\neventually pulls another interesting thing in this, around 1897, critics argue that he's making\nthis stuff up and demand that he present Diana Vaughan, suppose satanic high\npriestess toddler killer. And he says, oh, we're going\nto have a press conference. She'll appear and say all\nof this stuff as she returns to the church and possibly becomes a nun. And so people show up, you know, high figures in the\nCatholic church shows up and he does know Diana\nVaughan and Jogand-Pagès goes, it's all a hoax. I made it up. You're all a bunch\nof idiots for believing it. Okay? You, you members of the church, especially just the gullible morons you are. And that's it. He confesses. To this day however, you will find people who will insist that it's actually true because\nthey desperately want it to be true. But this is I think\nthe milieu that, I like that word, that this\ncomes out of, and this is this whole kind of unhealthy mix. So France to me is the only place that in the decade preceding it, that something like\nthis would be concocted. So it was either created by some sort of unknown person there, but I still think that even though he dies in like 1879, that in Maurice\nJoly's troubled career, he went from being an opponent of French Emperor Napoleon III, which is what the whole\nDialogues was written against. And then he was, for a time, a close political ally of a\nFrench politician by the name of Adolphe Cremieux. So Adolphe Cremieux, what's\nhe got going for him? Well, he was kind of a radical politician. He was an opponent of Napoleon\nIII. He was a Freemason. Oh, and he was Jewish. In fact, at one point, I think he was actually the head both of the Scottish Rite in\nFrance and an important figure in the Alliance Israélite, the Jewish organization in France. So he was publicly very\nprominently Jewish and Masonic. So someone else who would\nhave linked them together. Joly, as he did with virtually everyone, this was a guy whose\nlife largely consisted of duel threats and fistfights. So he gets angry at Cremieux. And it's exactly the type\nof thing that he might write to vent his spleen about it. But he died, probably a suicide. That's kind of difficult to tell. In obscurity, his son seems\nto have inherited most of his literary works. And his son then became a journalist to work\nfor newspapers in France in the 1890s, but was also\nassociated with some people on the fringes of the Okhrana or the\nRussian press in France. So one of the little\nthings that had happened by this time is that France and Russia had become allies, even\nthough their political systems are completely incompatible. And so the Russians were using money to subsidize French newspapers\nthat were championing the alliance between the\ntwo, Russian meddling. Okay? Now they're just paying\nto have the right kind of newspapers come out. So there's this whole\nconnection between the kind of Russian journalistic world and the French journalistic world and all of these scandals, which are\ngoing on and Joly's son... And then, you know, 10\nyears down the road, this thing pops up in a\nnewspaper in St. Petersburg. That's where I think the origins lay. - Why do you think it took off? Why do you think it grabbed a large number of people's imaginations? And even after it was\nshown to be not actually what it's supposed to be,\npeople still believe it's real. - Well, it doesn't take off immediately. Okay? It never receives\nany kind of wide... I mean, nobody much reads\nthe first edition of it. There are something like\n18 or 19 different versions it goes through. I mean, people leave this\nprotocol out or leave another one. As time goes on, there's more and more emphasis on Jews and less and less on Freemasons. And the whole thing could have begun as an anti-Masonic tract. I mean, you could leave\nJews out of it entirely and just turn it into a\nMasonic plot to rule the world. But let's just throw them in as well, since the two things are already\nbeing combined elsewhere. It doesn't become a big\ndeal until really after the First World War because\nthe initial versions of it are all in Russian. And, you know, let's face it, while that's widely read in Russia, it's not much read anywhere else. It's a different alphabet. Nobody can even see what it means. So it has no particular\ninfluence outside of Russia, but then you get to 1919, and you get all these\ndifferent versions of it. So suddenly you get two\nEnglish versions in the US, another English version in\nBritain, a German edition, a French edition, a Dutch edition. Everybody is coming up with these things. So it's not until in\nthe immediate aftermath of the First World War\nthat this metastasizes and it begins to show up in all of these different foreign editions. And I think that it just\nhas to do with the changes that have taken place during the war. One of the things that\npeople began looking for was that, why was there a war? We've just had this whole\ndisastrous war and the world has been turned upside down. So there has to be some kind\nof explanation for that. I don't know. And one of the things this offered to see, there's this evil plan, there's this evil plan that\nhas been put into motion and this could possibly\nexplain what's taking place. The reason why \"The Protocols\" were I think widely bought\nthen and why they still are in many ways is the same\nreason that the Taxil hoax I was talking about was\nbecause it told a story that people wanted to believe. So in France in the 1890s, there was widespread\nsuspicion of Freemasons. It was seen as a somewhat sinister secretive organization,\ncertainly secretive. And there was also, again, the same sort of generalized prejudices about Jews, clannish,\ndistinct, too much influence, all of the things that went on. So it was sort of easy to combine\nthose two things together. And even though Taxil\nadmits it was a hoax, there were those who argued\nthat it's just too accurate. It describes things too\ncompletely to be a hoax. And then you get the same arguments. In fact, I've heard the same\narguments with \"The Protocol.\" I don't even buy this as\nan example of plagiarism because you can't actually\nprove what's being plagiarized in any sense. To me, \"The Protocols\" are a\nprime example of what I call a turd on a plate. These things crop up. I\nhave to explain that now. - Yeah, please.\n- But I have to. What is a turd on a plate? Well, a turd on a plate\nis a turd on a plate. Suppose you come in and\nthere's a plate sitting on the table and there's a turd on it. Now the first thing you're going\nto want is, is that a turd? Is it a human turd?\nWhere did it come from? Why would someone poop on a plate? There are all these\nquestions that come to mind. It makes no sense. But\nthat's what you come up... It's just there. Right? I don't know where it came\nfrom, I don't know why, but there's a turd on a plate and that's what the protocols are. They're just there. - But the reality is, just\nlike with a turd on a plate, you take a picture of that\nin modern day and it becomes a meme, becomes viral and becomes a joke on all social media and now\nis viewed by tens of millions of people or whatever. It becomes popular. So wherever the turd came from, it did captivate the imagination. - Yeah. - It did speak to something. - It seemed to provide an explanation. - Can you just speak to Jew hatred? Is it just an accident of history? Why was it the Jews versus the Freemasons? Is it the collective mind\nsearching for a small group to blame for the pains of civilization? And then Jews just\nhappened to be the thing that was selected at\nthat moment in history? - It goes all the way back to the Greeks. Let's blame them. So one of the first\noccasions you find the idea that Jews are a distinct, mean-spirited, nasty people goes back to a Greco-Egyptian\nhistorian named Manetho. This is around, I think, 300 BC. Early. Can't even rope the Romans into this one. So Manetho is trying to write a history of\nthe dynasties of Egypt. I think his history of\ndynasties of Egypt still is one of the basic works in this, but he tells this whole story which essentially describes\nthe first blood libels, that the Jews, to celebrate their various religious holidays, would capture Greeks and\nfatten them up in the basement and then slaughter them and\neat them or drain their blood or do something. Yeah, it's just the earlier\nversion of that kind. Also, I think it repeats\nthe Egyptian version of the Exodus out of Egypt, which is quite different\nthan the biblical version. In this case, the Egyptians, they stole all the stuff\nout of the Egyptians' houses and ran off into the desert. - The Jews stole all\nthe stuff and ran off? - Yeah, Hebrews. Hebrews robbed the Egyptians.\nThey were taken in. We took them in and sheltered\nthem, gave them jobs, and then they, like, stole\nall the jewelry and ran away. We didn't even chase them. We\nwere glad to see them gone. So it's a different... It's a different narrative on that story. But it essentially portrays\nthe Jews as being hostile. They don't like other people. They're contemptuous of\nother people's religions, the rest of it. And see, the Greeks tended\nto think of themselves as being extremely cosmopolitan. Now, the Greeks ran across\npeople worshiping other gods. They go, oh, this is just our\ngods under different names. Everything was sort of\nadjusted into their landscape. So you end up with that kind of hostility, which was there at the time. And that was probably\ninfluenced also by some of these earlier rebellions\nthat had taken place in Egypt. During the Roman period, you not only have the\nJudean rebellion in 70 AD, but you have a couple of other uprisings in North Africa, and very bloody affairs. And in some cases, Jews begin massacring\nother people around them. They start killing the Greeks. The Greeks start killing them. So there was a fair amount\nof, from that period on, a certain amount of bad\nblood, of mutual contempt between Greeks, or between Hellenes, between the people who became Hellenized, as the Romans would be, and the Jews. And the Romans also seems\nto have developed much of that idea. They consider Judea as\nbeing a horrible place to have to govern, inhabited by a stubborn, obnoxious people. Not well-liked. So that's really where you see\nthe earliest version of that. And the reasons for it\nwould be complicated. What you could say is\nthat going back to Manetho into the Roman period, Jews, Judeans frequently\nexperienced difficulties, conflicts with other\npeople living around them. And part of that probably\nhad to do with the diaspora, which was the movement. Well, you get the idea. The Romans came and kicked\neverybody out, which they didn't. Jews had been leaving\nJudea since it was a poor, limited area and moving to areas like North\nAfrica, Egypt, Cyrenaica, all the way into Southern France. They moved widely around the Roman Empire. So that sense of both distinctness and hostility existed since ancient times. So it wasn't just... The attitude of the Church\ntowards Jews was mixed by... Well, one of the ideas, of course, is that at the end of time, just before the Second Coming, one of the signs, how are we going to know\nthat Jesus is going to return and the world is going to end? Well, the Jews will all convert. There will be a mass conversion.\nThey'll see the light. So there have to be\nJews around to do that, or we won't, it's like\na canary in a coal mine. You have to have them there to tip it off. So that was one of the\narguments as to why, within the Church, as to why Jews would not\nbe forcibly converted, beyond the fact that it's\njust kind of bad policy to forcibly convert people\nbecause you don't know whether it's sincere. But they need to be preserved\nas a kind of artifact which will then redeem\nitself at the end of time. It's not something which is encouraged. It predates Christianity. And in Christianity, of\ncourse, in its own way just sort of plagiarizes the whole Jewish thing, doesn't it? I mean, I hesitate to use that\nterm, but that's what you do. It's just like, well, we're the Jews now. Okay, you used to have a\nunique relationship with God, but now it's been passed over to us and so, you know, thanks. Thanks for the Bible. You\nknow, I can remember that. My mom's side, I was periodically\nexposed to Sunday school. And pretty much the Old\nTestament was always presented as if somehow it was the history of like, for lack of a better term,\nEuropeans in some way. It was sort of a Christian history. It was all the prequel to that. And there'd be some sort of, first the term Hebrew was\nalways used, never Jews. So, you know, the ancient\nHebrews and somehow the Hebrews just sort of\nbecame the Christians. And I don't know, the Jews just got, they didn't get a memo or something? So it's basically like Christianity, the prequel is the Old Testament. Yeah, but they just\nsort of take over. Okay. We have the special dispensation\nnow. Thank you very much. You're an artifact. - So it's interesting. So this whole narrative that\nI would say is kind of like a viral meme started, as\nyou described, in 300 BC. It just carried on in various\nforms and morphed itself and arrived after the\nindustrial revolution into a new form to the\n19th and 20th century, and then somehow captivated\neverybody's imagination. I think that modern antisemitism\nis very much a creation of the modern world and\nthe industrial revolution. It's largely a creation\nof Jewish emancipation. It's the nasty flip side of that. Okay? All of the restrictions are thrown off, but now also you become the focus of much more attention\nthan what you had before. You know, prior to that, you had the kind of ghettoization, which worked both ways. I mean, there were rabbis\nwho praised the ghettos as a protection of Jews\nagainst the outside world, because inside we can\nlive our life as we wish and we're unmolested. Whereas if we were, the great\nfear is that if we were sort of absorbed into this larger\nworld, we'll lose our identity. That sort of question comes\nup in the 18th century in things like the Haskalah\nmovement in Germany, because the German Jews\nwere always at the sort of cutting edge of\nassimilation and modernity. Moses Mendelssohn was an\nexample of that, arguing that, you know, we just need to become Germans. So, you know, as much as possible, synagogues should look\nlike Lutheran churches, things should be given in good German. And that's the way, we need\nto become Jewish Germans. We don't want to become\na kind of group of people who are apart in that way. And that has created\ngreat tensions ever since. You know, one of the essential\npoints that seems to me in anti-Semitism, anti-Jewism,\nis that all the Jews are in this together. Isn't that one of the things? Okay. They're always talking about\nas if they're collective. Jews this, Jews that, as if it's a single, undifferentiated mass of\npeople who all move and speak in the same way. From my personal experience,\nnot being Jewish, incredibly diverse in many ways, really. One of the things that\nanti-Semitism proposes is a continuity or a\nsingularity of Jewish identity that never existed. - Just like you said, in one\nhand, there's a good story, in the other hand is the truth. And oftentimes the good story wins out. And there's something about\nthe idea that there's a cabal of people, whatever\nthey are, in this case, our discussion is Jews\nseeking world domination, controlling everybody, is\nsomehow a compelling story. It gives us a direction\nof a people's to fight, of a peoples to hate on\nwhich we project our pain. Because life is difficult. Life for many, for most\nis full of suffering. And so we channel that suffering into\nhatred towards the other. Maybe if you can just zoom out, what do you from this\nparticular discussion learn about human nature that we pick the other\nin this kind of way? And we divide each other up in groups and then construct stories. And like constructing those stories and they become really\nviral and sexy to us. And then we channel the hatred. We use those stories to channel our hatred towards the other. - Well, yeah, Jews aren't\nthe only recipient of that. I mean, anytime you hear\npeople talking about Jews this or that, white people this or that, black people this or\nthat, Asians this or that, where they're an undifferentiated mass who apparently all share\nsomething in common. Well, nobody's really thinking. And the other thing\nyou'll find is that people who will express those views when pressed will argue that, oh, well, if they actually know\nanybody from those groups, those are okay. It's like Nazis. They'll all think, oh,\nthis is an okay Jew. They're all right. They were always constantly\nmaking exceptions in one form. When they actually meant\nan actual human being and they seem to be fairly\nnormal, well, they were okay. So what it was that they\nhated weren't actual people for the most part. It was just this kind of\ngolliwog vision that they had of them. You're not even talking about\nreal people. I don't know. What does that tell\nyou about human nature? Well, okay, in 70 odd years, what have I learned about\nmy fellow creatures? One, I don't actually\nunderstand them any better than I ever did. In fact, less so. Okay. I would say this, when I was 17, I thought that I had the\nworld much more figured out than I do now. Completely deluded, but it seemed to make much more sense and\nI could categorize things. Basic take upon human beings, most people, most of the time are polite, cooperative, and kind until they're not. And the exact tipping point\nand moment in which they go from one to the other is unpredictable. - God, that's brilliantly put. Speaking of the tipping point, you gave a series of\nlectures on murderers, crimes in the 20th century. One of the crimes that you described is the Manson Family murders. And that combines a lot of the elements of what we've been talking about and a lot of the elements of the human\nnature that you just described. So can you just tell the\nstory at a high level as you understand it? - The Manson Family. Well, you begin with Charles Manson, who's the key element in this. And Charles Manson for most of his life up until the time that he's around 33 is an unexceptional petty criminal. In and out of prison, reform\nschool from an early age, not really associated with violent crimes. He did stuff like steal\ncars, write bad checks, became an unsuccessful\npimp and drug dealer. So around 1967, he gets\nout of his latest stint in federal lockup in Terminal Island near\nLos Angeles, California. By that time, he's learned\nhow to play the guitar, has ambitions to become a musician, and also has proclaimed\nhimself a Scientologist. Not that he ever seems to have practiced, but that's what he\nwould claim that he was. Kind of, you know, self-educated himself in\nprison to a certain degree. And so when he gets out of prison in '67, he was a model prisoner. He behaved himself and seemed, you can sort of imagine his life is going in a completely different direction. And here again, I'm going\nto say something kind of good about Charles Manson, which is that he actually\nwas a decent singer. If you really sort of\nlisten to some of the stuff he did, he's not a great\nsinger, but he could have, other people got recording\ncontracts with less talent than he had, and he could play guitar. The Beach Boys actually do record one of his songs without him. - How would you evaluate\nHitler's painting? Compared to Charles Manson? - Well, you're supposed\nto say it's terrible. - Okay.\n- Okay. - It looks average to me.\n- Yeah. It's a landscape. - I mean, if you didn't know\nit was Hitler, would you, I don't know what people\nwill say about it. - Sorry for the distraction. - It's just, he's an average\npainter. That's what it was. It's nothing like crazy\ngenocidal maniac paintings. You don't really have those. So Manson, he could have done that. He probably could have, he made certain inroads\ninto the music industry. And if he hadn't been such a weirdo, he might've gotten further with it, but his life could have\ntaken a different turn. So this is one of the questions I have. Where did a guy who is an unexceptional\ncareer petty criminal suddenly emerge into some sort\nof criminal mastermind, a Svengali, who can bend all of these people to his\nwill and get them to go out and commit murder? That's a real shift that you have. So the first thing you\nkind of could tell you that something odd is going\non is he gets out of prison in LA County, and he's on parole. Parolees are supposed to have a job, not supposed to leave the\njurisdiction of their parole. He heads straight for the Bay Area, violates parole right off the bat. Two weeks later, he drifts\ninto the parole office in the Bay Area, whereupon he should have\nbeen arrested and sent back to Terminal Island. But instead, they just assign him a... I don't know, maybe things\nwere easier then in some way. So he gets assigned a parole\nofficer, Michael Smith. Michael Smith is initially\nhandling a number of parolees, but after a\nwhile, once he takes on Manson, he only has one parolee he's\nsupervising, Charlie Manson, which is odd. And you also find out that Michael Smith, in addition to being a parole officer, is a graduate student at\nthe University of California studying group dynamics, especially the influence of\ndrugs on gangs in groups. And he's also connected to the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic, which is a place where the influence... Haight Ashbury had lots of\ndrugs and lots of groups. So Charlie Manson never\ngets a regular job, hangs around with young girls, ex-cons, engages in criminal activity,\nis repeatedly arrested, but nothing ever sticks for\nthe next couple of years. So who gets that type of thing? Who gets a get out of jail\nfree card? Informants. So here is what, again,\nthis is speculation. But Manson at some point\nafter he got out of prison is getting this treatment\nbecause he is recruited as a confidential informant. - For who? - For who? That's the interesting question. So, probably not for any\nlocal police departments. My best suspicion is probably the Federal Bureau of\nNarcotics, precursor to the DEA. Federal parolee, federal parole officer, come graduate student in drugs in group dynamics, and\neventually with permission, he goes back down to LA. And what is he part of when he's there? Well, he's on the fringes\nof the music industry. That's how much, you know, knows Wilsons and elsewhere, which also brings him to the fringes of the film industry. So one of the things if you're\nsort of looking in terms of Hollywood music industry\nelites and the flow of, oh, and he's also dealing in drugs and girls. So an early version of Jeffrey Epstein. - Yeah. - Manson attracted lots\nof underage runaways and trained them, used\nthem also associating with biker gangs who\nproduced drugs, et cetera. So that's part of what, he's an informant in the\nmovement of drugs basically within the film music industries. And he's given pretty\nmuch a kind of free reign at that point. What then happens in August\nof 1969 is that there are these murders, you know, first Sharon Tate and her\nfriends in Cielo Drive. I think everybody has\nprobably pretty much heard that story before. And of course the question\nis why Cielo Drive, why Sharon Tate, Frykowski, and the rest of them that he has... Manson was familiar with the place. He had been there before. Members of the family\nhad been there before. So he knew where it was. It\nwasn't an easy place to find. I mean, the way that\nthat house, the house, the original house is no longer there, but the same sort of property\nand a house is built there. And if you didn't know where it was, it's not someplace,\nlet's just go for a drive in the Hollywood Hills and\nmurder people in a house. Well, that isn't the one\nthat you would come across. There are lots of connections there. Wojciech Frykowski, who was\none of the people killed at the Cielo Drive house was\ninvolved in drug dealing. That's a possible\nconnection between the two. Probably a fairly likely one. Probably not unfortunate\nSharon Tate at all. She was probably in the wrong\nplace at the wrong time. Her husband might've been, you never know. And then the next night\nafter the slaughter there, which by the way Manson is not at, so this is one of the\ninteresting things about it, Charles Manson doesn't\nkill any of these people. His crime is supposedly ordering\nthe killings to be done. He supposedly thought that the killings at the Tate house were sloppy, and he was going to give\neverybody a crash course in how you apparently commit\nseemingly random murders. So the next night he\ntakes a group of people over to the La Bianca's house\nin a different section of LA. And you've got Leno and\nRosemary LaBianca, the guy is a grocer, his wife runs a dress shop, upper middle-class, and they're bound gagged\nand hacked to death. And as at the Tate residence, various things like piggy are written, various messages in blood, things that are supposed\nto look like cat's paws because one of the groups\ntrying to be framed for the idea was the Black Panthers. So the general story that comes out in the subsequent trial is\nthat this was all a part of something called Helter Skelter, which Manson supposedly\nwas an idea that... That sounds like a Beatles song. That's where he got it from. He thought the Beatles were talking to him through their music and\nthat there was going to be an apocalyptic race war. And this was all part of\na plan to set this off. So this is why the Black\nPanthers were trying to be implicated in this. Although how it was supposed to do that is never really explained. Here is what I think was really happening, what really happened and how\nI think it fits together. Before Sharon Tate and her\nfriends, or the LaBiancas, were killed, there was a\nmurder by members of the family of some of the same people\ninvolved in the later killings of a musician drug manufacturer\nby the name of Gary Hinman. So Manson again was\ninvolved in the drug trade, and Hinman made them. He was a cook, basically. And he brewed them up in his basement, sold the drugs to Manson, who sold them to biker gangs\nlike the Straight Satans, which was one of the groups that he used and they distributed them elsewhere. Well, one day the Straight\nSatans show up and complain that the last batch of meth, or whatever it was that\nthey got from Manson, had made some of their\nbrothers very, very ill. And they were quite unhappy about that. And they wanted their $2,000 back. Manson had gotten those\ndrugs from Gary Hinman. So he is unhappy and he\nsends Bobby Beausoleil and a couple of the girls\nover to Hinman's place to get the money from him. It's a story that's later\nrelated, I think, by Susan Atkins. Hinman denied that\nthere was anything wrong with his drugs and refused to pay up, which led to a interrogation\ntorture session in which he was killed. - Ah, yeah... - And the idea was here, what\nare we going to do with that? Well, one of the other groups\nthat Hinman had sold drugs to were, guess what? People associated with the Black Panthers. So we'll leave these things up and they will make it\nlook like they will do it. So it's Bobby Beausoleil,\nwho then takes Hinman's car and decides to drive it up the coast. By the way, with a bloody\nknife with Hinman's blood and hair on it, and blood\non the seats in the car. And then he pulls it\noff the road and decides to sleep it off and he gets busted. So find Hinman's body, find Beausoleil in Hinman's car with a bloody knife with him. Yeah, he gets arrested. So Beausoleil was very popular\nwith some of the girls. There's consternation\nin the family that Bobby has been arrested. So how can we possibly\nget Bobby out of jail? Copycat killings! So if we go kill more\npeople and we make it look the same, and see, Bobby\ncouldn't possibly have done it. No, see, he just borrowed the car. Okay, he stole the car, but\nthe knife was already in. He didn't have anything to do with this. So that, to me, makes the most\nsense out of what followed. - How often do people\ntalk about that theory? That's an interesting theory. - Well, it's there. It's just not the one that... Bugliosi wanted to go with Helter Skelter because it was, again, it was a story that\npeople could understand. And it was sensational\nand it would catch on. Also, another probable\nissue in that was that his star witness was Linda Kasabian. Linda Kasabian, she was\npresent at both the Tate and LaBianca murders. She didn't participate in the\nkillings, according to her. She sort of drives the car, but everybody else talked\nabout what had happened. Well, okay, she turns state's evidence and gets total immunity, and it's largely in her testimony that all the rest of the case is based. Now, if you start\nthrowing into the equation that she proclaimed her\nlove for Bobby Beausoleil and this could end that\nshe, according to others, was the chief proponent of\nthe copycat killings, well, then that would get messy. Now there's one guy that's\nat the center of this. It's Charles Manson. He ordered all of this\ndone to ignite a race war, even though how would any of that do it? - Okay. So that doesn't make sense. But he is nevertheless at the center of this because he's the\nglue of the family, right? - He exerts a tremendous amount of psychological control over them. - How was he able to do that? Sorry to interrupt. Because he said he was a petty criminal. It does seem he was pretty\nprolific in his petty crimes. He did a lot of them. - He had a lot of access to LSD. - [Lex] Okay. Okay. - Which he started\ngetting at the Free Clinic in San Francisco. So lots and lots of it floating around. Some descriptions of the\nfamily at Spahn Ranch is that people were basically taking acid on a daily basis, which by the way was\nalso a potential problem with Linda Kasabian's testimony\nsince she also admitted to being high most of the\ntime and also thinking she was a witch. All right? So you want to put her... Okay. Where do you want to go with that? See, if Manson wasn't Manson, if he hadn't actually acted like the crazed hippie psycho goofball that Bugliosi painted him as being, then Kasabian's testimony\nwouldn't have been as strong. Because you could... I mean, the first thing against her is you've gotten immunity\nfor telling the story the prosecution wants. Yeah, that's a little iffy. And we won't even bring\nin the witch and the drugs and being in love with Bobby Beausoleil. All right. So if Manson had been dressed like you, sitting there in a suit and\ntie and he behaved himself and spoken normally things might have... This isn't to say that\nhe wasn't guilty as hell. So what he supposedly\ndid was to inspire all of these killings. And I think that's probably, you know, sort of beginning with the Hinman killing. He told them to go over there\nand get the money one way or the other. I don't know whether it's\nclear whether he told them if you don't get the money,\nkill him, but Hinman's dead. And then you might also\nhave seen the value in terms of having copycat killings as a way of throwing off any other kind of blame. The other story you get\nis that one of the people who had lived at the Cielo\nHouse for Sharon Tate was before, was a record\nproducer by the name of Terry Melcher. Melcher supposedly, as\nthe general story goes, had welched on a deal with Manson in terms of a record contract. He screwed over Manson in\nsome sort of a record deal and Manson wanted to get\nrevenge and sent them to kill everybody in the house. Which again, doesn't make much sense. One, Manson knew that Melcher\nwasn't living there any more. He probably knew where Melcher was living. If he wanted to get Melcher,\nhe could have found him. It wasn't that difficult to do. And... So that's, it's not\nrevenge on Terry Melcher that drew him there. He was familiar with the house. So if the idea was to simply\ncommit random killings that would throw, that\nwould muddy the whole waters with the Hinman killing, then you might pick\nsome place you knew of, you knew the place was rented out, there'd be someone there,\nyou really didn't care. In the same way that the LaBianca seemed to have been, Manson was familiar with that because it\nsupposedly had been the scene of creepy crawling. This is little interesting things that the family would be taught to do. Creepy crawling is when you\nsneak into somebody's house at night, while they're there asleep or when they're not there\nand you move things around. So when they get up in the morning or they come home, they'll suddenly notice\nthat someone has been in their house, which will freak them out, which is the whole point of that. - But it doesn't it\nseem like the murderer, the creepy crawling was the, well, creepy crawling may be, but it doesn't it seem like the murder, like some of the other\npeople you've covered, like the Zodiac Killer,\nthe murder is the goal. Maybe there's some\npsychopathic kind of artistry to the murder that the Zodiac Killer had and the messaging behind that. - Yeah.\n- But it seems like with the, at least the way you're describing it, with the Charles Manson\nfamily, the murder was just, they just had a basic\ndisregard for human life and the murder was a\nconsequence of operating in the drug underworld. - So Manson set up a kind of base, a thing called the Spahn Movie Ranch, which was an old movie ranch out on the northwest edge of LA. And they just kind of camped out there. He used the girls, in\nparticular, Squeaky Fromme, to get the owner or operator,\nI think George Spahn, to let them hang out there. And basically, she slept with him and he was perfectly happy\nto let them hang out. They also had a place out\nin the desert that they had. They dealt in credit\ncard fraud, stolen cars. It was kind of a chop shop\nthat they ran out of the place. So he had a fairly good\nlittle criminal gig going, which with the protection he\nhad probably would have... The one thing they couldn't\ncover him on was murder. - So you think there was,\nif he was an informer, you think there was still a connection between DEA, FBI, CIA, whatever with him throughout this until\nhe'd come into murder? - The real question is, there is a book written on this by Tom O'Neill called \"Chaos\". I'm not necessarily saying\nit's the easiest thing to get through. There's a lot of material there. I don't think O'Neill\nnecessarily knows what to make of some of the stuff he came up with, but he does a very good\njob of sort of demolishing the whole Bugliosi narrative. And one of the people\nhe mentions is a name that I had run into elsewhere, and so I really paid attention\nto it when I saw it again. And the name is Reeve Whitson. And Reeve Whitson shows up\non the fringes even though he has no judicial function. He sort of hangs around\nBugliosi in the prosecution. He's some sort of, he's\njust kind of there. In the same way that he\nwas one of these guys, he grew his hair kind of\nlong, wore bell bottoms, hung around the music\ncommunity and elsewhere in Hollywood, but no one could\ntell you exactly what he did. I know what he did later, but a decade later he\nshows up as a CIA officer in Central America. Hmm. So Reeve Whitson, later\nin his career at least, is CIA. What was he doing in 1969? What is he doing in this? The other thing about it\nis he appears to have been the person who called... There's a whole question\nof when the bodies at Cielo Drive are discovered. So the general story is that Sharon Tate's\nhousekeeper shows up around 8:30 in the morning, finds the bloody scene and goes screaming next door. But there was another fellow who knew, I think the owner of the\nhouse is a photographer, last name would be Hatami. He gets a call earlier in\nthe morning saying that there have been murders there. And the person he recalls\ncalling him is Reeve Whitson. So someone had been at the house before the bodies were discovered and they had not called the police. So I don't know what's going\non there, but it's a... It's a curious kind of situation. And Manson in a lot of ways just kind of self-immolates himself. I mean, his behavior at\nthe trial is bizarre. It's threatening. It's disruptive. He's got his girls out on the street, carving Xs in their\nforehead, carrying knives. One of the attorneys, initially\nhis attorney, Ron Hughes, becomes Van Houten's attorney. And he figures out that the three girls, supposedly on Charlie's\ninsistence, are gonna confess. And they've confessed\nthat it was all their idea and Charlie had nothing to do with it. Hughes doesn't like this\nbecause his defense for her is that she was under his influence and therefore not responsible\nfor her own actions, he was having psychic control, so he refuses to go along with it, there's a break in the trial, he goes camping up in the mountains with some friends, disappears\nduring a rainstorm, and then some months later his\ndecomposed remains are found. Now, rumors, always the rumors. Okay? What would history be without rumors? Held that, ah, see, members of the family, they were pissed off at Ron Hughes because he messed up\nCharlie's idea to get him off and so they killed him. Oh, maybe they did, maybe he drowned. That's absolutely impossible to say. You got that kind of story. There's a guy named Juan Flynn, who was an employee at the\nSpahn Ranch, didn't like Manson. Held Manson responsible\nfor the murder of his boss. He would testify that Manson told him that he had ordered all the killings and that Manson also admitted\nthat he had killed 35 people. Maybe he did. On the other hand, Juan\nFlynn didn't like him and he had no, other than his word, had no real proof of what he was saying. So please understand me\nin this case is that, unlike some people who argue\nthat Charles Manson got a raw deal, I don't think that's the case. I think that he influenced\ntremendous influence over the people there\nthrough drugs, through... Sex was another frequent component in it. He had a real whammy over a\nlot of these people's minds. I'm not sure how, that\nstill kind of puzzles me. He was a scrawny guy and he\nwasn't physically intimidating. I mean, even a lot of women wouldn't be\nphysically intimidated by him, but he nonetheless had this\nreal psychological power. And there were... If you look around him,\nthe male followers he had, they were fairly big guys. So he could get people\nto do what he wanted. And, again, to me, the simplest explanation\nfor this is that it began with the Hinman killing and probably on Manson's instigation, the\nothers were copycat killings to throw off what was going on. If I was a cop, that's what I would focus on\nbecause that seems to make the most sense. - It's fascinating that he's able to have that much psychological control over those people without\nhaving a very clear ideology. So it's a cult. - Yes. The great focus on Charlie, the leader, the excessive devotion. - But there's not like a... Maybe, there's not an\nideology behind that. Like something like Scientology\nor some kind of religious or some kind of, I don't\nknow, utopian ideology, nothing like this? - No, I think that Manson, again, was essentially a criminal, he had a sociopathic\nmindset and he hit upon a pretty good deal. - Yeah, but how do people\nconvince anybody of anything? With a cult, usually you have\neither an ideology or you have maybe personal, religion,\nlike you said, sex and drugs. But underneath that, can\nyou really keep people with sex and drugs? You have to kind of convince\nthem that you love them in some deep sense. Like there's a commune of love. - You have a lot of\npeople there in the cult. They have some sort of, what we like to call,\ndysfunctional families. - [Lex] Yeah. - A lot of the females in\nparticular seem to have come from more or less middle-class families, but those are full of dysfunction. Their parents didn't love them, they are semi-runaways and now\nthey had this whole family. A lot of the younger women had children, some of them by Manson,\nsome of them by the others. They sort of bonded together. - And again, we return to\nthat pull towards belonging that gets us humans into trouble. So it does seem that there was a few\ncrimes around this time. So the Zodiac killer. - Well, California,\nwhich is where I'm from. I remember this period vividly. - Okay.\n- So by the way, the Tate-LaBianca killings\noccurred on my birthday, the year I graduated from high school. So, I remember this. - Happy Birthday. - A term which has been used for that... There's a writer by the name of Todd Wood who's coined, I wish\nI'd come up with this, Killerfornia, which is just sort of a chronicle of the serial\nkillers and disappearances in the late '60s and '70s. So you've got the Zodiac,\nyou've got other ones. I mean, you know, I hate to say it, I'm not trying to be flippant\nabout it, but I mean, young female hitchhikers were disappearing at an alarming rate in\nNorthern California. Their bodies that have\nnever been attributed, some think that the Zodiac's victims, but it was a dangerous time. Edmund Kemper, you know, the\nCo-ed Killer was another one. There were a lot of creepy\npsychopaths running around. I don't know whether it\nwas something in the water or what was going on, but it\nwas a menacing in some cases. Hitchhiking, especially if\nyou were alone and female was not something you wanted to do in much of the Golden State, certainly\nnot up around the Bay Area. So a lot of these strange sort of killings that were going on, the Zodiac is, it's one of those things\nwhere you have these people who have theories about it. If you don't share their theory, then you're part of the problem\nin some form or another. So I'm not sure, for instance, that the Zodiac killings\nwere all committed by the same person. I think there might have been\nmultiple people involved. And the first killings are all of couples. It's very sort of clear that they, I remember in my examination, one of the things I was\nlooking at specifically, what else is there to say\nabout the Zodiac killings? So what I was going to look\nat is that there are all of these accusations that there\nis an occult aspect to it. There was some sort of ritualistic aspect. So I looked at different\nthings, locations, victims, phases of the Moon! That's always worth looking at. I didn't find much\ncorrespondence in any of those. In one of the killings, I think the one in Lake Berryessa, he\ndoes appear in this kind of weird hooded costume. He's got his symbol, the\nsort of compass or aiming, reticle, circle with a cross through it. It can mean a variety of things. He used guns and he used knives, but he certainly had a thing for couples, except in the last of the killings, which is of a cab driver\nin downtown San Francisco, who he shoots in full view of witnesses, which is completely atypical. - And also when he was\nstabbing the victims, it doesn't seem like\nhe was very good at it. Or if the goal was to kill them, he wasn't very good at it\nbecause some of them survived. - Yeah, he doesn't, he's not\nparticularly thorough about it. He seems to have had much more... More of the violence seems to be directed at the females than the males. - So I mean, there's a couple\nof questions to ask here. First of all, did people see his face? - There is a composite\ndrawing of his face, which I think is based\nupon the Stine killing, the cab driver killing,\nwhere there were people who saw him, or who\nclaimed that they saw him. The other ones were all\nwhen it was fairly dark. - Right. - I'm not sure that anyone\nelse got a look at his face. The one that occurred in\nthe daylight at Berryessa, he was wearing a mask. So there's something in common\ninitially in the targeting of victims, which\ndoesn't, in the last case. Then after that, there's just the different\ncases of where... There's a pretty good\ncase to be made of a woman who claims, I think she and her small child were\npicked up, her car broke down, she got a flat tire, she was picked up by this\nguy who she got a very sort of strange vibe from, who\neventually just let her go. Well, you know, that might\nhave been the Zodiac. It might not have been. - You do this kind of rigorous\nlook saying like, okay, what is the actual facts that we know? Like reduce it to the thing\nthat we know for sure. And in speaking about his motivation, he said that he was collecting souls. - Souls for the afterlife. - For the afterlife. - That's kind of occulty. - Yeah. I mean, that's what, I believe, is it the Vikings or the Romans? They believed this, in battle... - You're essentially\nmaking sacrificial victims and they will be your ghostly\nservants in the afterlife. - Do you think he actually believed that? - Who knows? I mean, here's the question. Was he making that up just to be scary or is that what his actual... That's what he's saying his motivation is. So let's take him at face value. Rather than trying to wish\nthat into the cornfield, that is to get rid of it. Let's just take it. So he's claiming that he's\nkilling these people in order to acquire slave servants\nin the afterlife. He will subsequently go on\nto claim many more victims, I'm not sure if 44 eventually\nhe will have before he just kind of vanishes. One of the really interesting clues to me, when I was looking at that case, which I didn't find\nanybody else that tended to make much of... Is that it all has to do with this kind of Halloween card that\nhe sends to the press in San Francisco. And it's talking about sort\nof rope, by gun, by fire, and there's this whole sort of wheel. That's like the Zodiac's... But what was this drawn from? Where he got this from is from a Tim\nHolt western comic book, published in 1951. And you see the same thing on the cover. It's Wheel of Fortune, but with different forms\nof grisly death on it. And all of the things that\nhe mentioned are shown on the cover of this. So whoever put together that\ncard, saw that comic book. Well, that's kind of an interesting clue. So does that mean he's\na comic book collector? When would he have... I mean, that is one... And also, but where he got the idea from. So he's incorporating\nthese things from the... Then there are, of course, his\ncodes, which people have... Which aren't all that\ndifficult to decipher, probably because they weren't meant to be. The other thing that you\nfind often with serial or psychopathic killers is\nthey're toying with the press. I mean, this goes all the\nway back to Jack the Ripper. They get attention. And\nthen he just disappears. - Why do you think he was never caught? - I think they knew who to look for. There's nothing much to go on. I mean, there was a guy\nwho was long a suspect, and then eventually they\ntested his DNA and find that it didn't match any of\nthe things that they'd found. Again, it goes back to... I'm not even sure that it's\none person who's responsible for all of them. - Well, one of the interesting\nthings you bring up here, and our discussion of\nManson inspires this, but there does seem to be a connection, a shared inspiration between\nseveral killers here, the Zodiac, the Son of Sam, later, and the Monster of Florence. So is it possible there's\nsome kind of underworld that is connecting these people? - Well, you take the Zodiac, and you get his claim\nthat he's collecting souls for the afterlife. There are other things that are\noccultish connected to that. He may have picked some\nof the killing sites due to their physical location, to their position in a particular place. If you look at the Son\nof Sam case, of course, David Berkowitz will on and\noff claim that he was part of a satanic cult that\nwas carrying out, again, these killings, mostly of\ncouples and young women similar to the Zodiac, and that\nhe had only committed some of them and was witnesses at others. And that has really created\nthe whole idea that, yes, there is this, some kind of\nsatanic cult which engages in ritual murders. Then if you go all the way to Florence, you've got murders who go on and off for a long period of time, again, focusing on couples in isolated areas, which Italian prosecutors\nultimately tried to connect to some kind of satanic cult, although I'm not sure they ever made a particularly strong case for that. But that element comes\nup in all three of them. So you can, with a little imagination, argue that those similarities, that those things should come\nup in each of those cases in different places, either\nsuggest that, oddly enough, psychopathic criminals\nare all sort of thinking the same way, or that there is some sort\nof higher element involved in this, that there's some\nkind of common inspiration. You come back to something similar we were talking before\nabout, do pedophiles exist? Do pedophiles... Okay, so do satanic cults exist? Well, they do. There\nwas one in my hometown. Apparently quite harmless,\nas far as I know. But there are people who... Robes, here we come again, robes, cut the head off a chicken,\nnaked woman as an alter... You can get off on that, I\nsuppose, if that's your thing. So professed satanists\nexist, satanic cults exist, serial killers exist,\nritual murders exist. Are those things\nnecessarily connected? No. Could they be connected? Yes. Okay? There's nothing... Don't ever tell me that\nsomething is just too crazy for people to do, because\nthat's crazy talk. All right? - You've studied secret societies. You've gave a lot of amazing\nlectures on secret societies. It's fascinating to look at human history through the lens of secret societies, because they've permeated\nall of human history. You've talked about everything\nfrom the Knights Templar to Illuminati to Freemasons,\nlike we brought up. Freemasons lasted a long time. Illuminati, as you've talked about, in its sort of main form\nlasted a short time, but its legend... - Never gone away.\n- Never gone away. So maybe Illuminati is a\nreally interesting one. What was that? - Well, the Illuminati that\nwe know started in 1776. In fact, you can pin it down\nto a day, the 1st of May, May Day, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Germany, founded by a pProfessor Adam Weishaupt. It wasn't initially called the Illuminati, because that's not really\nthe name of the organization. It was called the Order\nof Perfectibilists. Apparently that changed. Weishaupt would say things like, never let our organization be known under its real name anywhere, which leaves wondering\nwhat's its real name. So Illuminati is simply\nthe plural of Illuminatus, which means one who is illuminated, one who has seen the light. So in Roman times, Christian\nconverts were Illuminati, because they had seen the light. Anyone who thinks... And there have been organizations\ncalled Illuminati... The term is not trademarked,\nnot copyrighted. Anybody who thinks they've\nseen the light about anything is an Illuminati, so it defines nothing. The symbol of the order was an owl, which interestingly\nenough is almost identical to the owl which is the\nemblem of the Bohemian Club. - [Lex] Oh boy... - Make of that what you will. I don't make that much out of it, because one owl looks\npretty much like another owl to me, but compare them. You know? You gotta\nkinda wonder about this. Just a little thing. Maybe there's some kind\nof connection there. So, but that supposedly has\nto do with the connection to the goddess Minerva, and\nthe owl was sacred to her, and the order was the Minerval, the person who was brought in. The number of levels changed over time. There was a higher level\nfor the order that people at the lower level didn't know about. Pretty typical for this. But the thing about Weishaupt\nwas that he was quite... He was a luminous\ncorrespondent with members with his Illuminati, both during the time that it legally existed\nin Bavaria and later on. So, Weishaupt himself\nlives, I think, until 1830. Dies in Goethe, which was ruled by an Illuminati prince, and so... Nothing ever happens to these men. No Illuminati has ever\nput to death or arrested in prison for any period of time. What happens is that their plan... Well, what was his plan? His plan was to essentially\nreplace all existing religions and governments in the world with a one-world order\ngoverned by the Illuminati. So to do this, you had to subvert and destroy\nall the existing order. And he argued the\npurpose for this is to... We wish to make men happy and free, but first we must make them good. - All right. - So that's what the order is all about. Of course, he also said\nthings like, oh man, is there nothing that you won't believe? Okay, so the myth would be used in that. Also thought women should\nbe brought into it. He had a rather interesting\nview about that, was that we should appeal to women, in part because women have\na chip on their shoulder, because they're left out of things. So we should appeal to\ntheir vanity on that point, and offer that in the future, all things will be open and\nthey will be emancipated. So we should hold out the\nprospect of female emancipation to attract them. Because he argued in the short term, there's no better way to\ninfluence men than through women. Get women on our side by\npromising them emancipation, but he made sure we'll\nnever actually deliver it to them, because the future\nworld will be a boys club. So he talks about these\nthings fairly openly. And this is where you get\nthis idea of some sort of a new world order, which is to be based upon the destruction of the existing order. So there are those who\nargue that there is a trail of dissent that leads from\nWeishaupt's Illuminati to the communist manifesto,\nand in fact, communism itself. That Marxism was simply a\nfurther restating of this idea. And you can draw some sort of connection. I mean, the idea never entirely goes away. The Bavarian government gets ahold of the order's inner texts. So the story is there, delivered to them. I think that Weishaupt gave them to him. I think he engineered\nthe exposure of his order because it gave him publicity. By being exposed in Bavaria,\nyou gained great renown, and they continued to recruit after this. And the Bavarian government actually bans the Illuminati four different times. Why? Because apparently the\nfirst three times didn't work. So the fourth one does. You can notice that it's like\nPapal bans on Freemasonry, and they just go on and on and on because\nthis clearly isn't working. - And you actually highlight the difference between,\nspeaking of publicity, that there's a difference\nbetween visibility and transparency, that a secret\nsociety could be visible, it could be known about,\nit could be quite popular, but you could still have\na secrecy within it. - You have no idea what's going on inside. - Yeah.\n- It's like a black box. If I set a black box on this table, we can see that there is a black box. What's in the black box? A cat? Who knows? - In fact, the secrecy\nmight be the very thing that makes it even more popular. - Adam Weishaupt, again, there's no more thing convincing\nthan a concealed mystery. Give people a concealed mystery in the... We need to make the order\nmysterious for that exact reason. Always hold out the\npossibility that knowledge, special knowledge that no\nmere mortals have other than you will have in that way. So he senses a lot of things. The use of vanity and\nego to recruit people, to influence both men and\nwomen, it's quite sophisticated. And as you might expect from a professor of canon law trained by Jesuits. I certainly don't think that\nit ceased when it was banned in Bavaria, because\neverybody just scatters and goes elsewhere, like Paris. And then you have the French Revolution. - So the idea of the\nIlluminati, to put it crudely, the branding is a really powerful one. And so it makes sense that it can, there's a thread\nconnecting it to this day, that a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies\ncan sort of adopt the brand. - Anybody can call it, you can go out and form a club\nand call it the Illuminati. - And if you're effective at it, I think it does attract,\nit's the chicken or the egg, but powerful people tend\nto have gigantic egos and people with gigantic egos tend to like the exclusivity of secret societies. And so like there's a, it's a gravitational force\nthat pulls powerful people to these societies. - It's exclusive. Only certain... And you also notice\nsomething goes back to, and we were talking about much earlier, when we were talking about\nintelligence, remember MICE? Ego.\n- Ego, yeah. - Ego is recruitment and control. That's a great Achilles\nheel in human beings, the exploitation of ego. - And of course, if we go back to the conversation of intelligence agencies,\nit would be very efficient and beneficial for intelligence\nagencies to infiltrate the secret societies, right? Like, cause that's where\nthe powerful people are. - Or the secret societies to infiltrate the intelligence agencies.\n- Oh boy. Well, I mean, that's\nactually, in all the lectures, I kind of had a sense that intelligence agencies\nthemselves are kind of secret societies, right? - Well, it comes down, I'll give you my definition\nof secret societies, what they come down to. One is that generally their\nexistence isn't secret. It's what they do is secret. It's what's in the box as\nopposed to the existence of the box. So one of the most important criterions is that they are self-selecting. You just don't join, they pick you. They decide whether or not\nyou're going to, they admit you. And oftentimes they will\nsort of recruit you. Once you have been recruited, you have to pass tests and initiations. And you also have to\nswear oaths of loyalty. Those are always very, very critical. So broadly speaking, what interest into an\nintelligence organization does, they decide whether you get in, you just don't automatically get the job. You have to pass tests,\na lie detector test, for instance, field training tests, a whole variety of tests. And then you're sworn to secrecy. You never talk about what you do, ever, or there will be dire consequences. So the method is very much the same. And also this idea of creating\na kind of insular group. Yeah. The organization is us and everyone else is outside of that. We are guardians of special knowledge. So this is the type of thing\nthat would generally happen if you question whatever any kind of intelligence agency did. Well, we know things that you don't. Why? Because we're the organization\nthat knows things. We collect information.\nWe know the secrets. We guard the secrets. Therefore, if we tell\nyou, you must believe us. - I have this sense that there are very powerful secret\nsocieties operating today, and we don't really\nknow or understand them. And the conspiracy\ntheories in spirit might have something to them, but are actually factually not correct. So like, you know, an effective powerful secret society or intelligence agency is not going to let you know anything that\nit doesn't want you to know. Right? - They'll probably mislead\nyou, if it gets any close. So I think, you know, the question is what's the most powerful or important secret society? Probably the one you don't know about. One that doesn't advertise its existence. The one which is never known\nanywhere under its real name. You've got things like the Bohemian Club. You've got the Bilderbergers,\nwhich is another sort of, you know, formed in the 1950s, largely the creation of a guy by the name of Jozef Retinger, Polish, mysterious, appears out of nowhere,\na schemer for years, a man expelled from Britain, France, and the United States\nat one point or another, long active in the Mexican labor movement. Right? Okay. Retinger is a mysterious figure. In fact, his, I think there\nwas even a book written about him called \"Eminence\nGrise\", gray eminence. The fellow who was a, the\nfront man for the Bilderbergers was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who was at one point a Nazi and then a Dutch freedom fighter. All right? Take your pick. But Retinger is the moving\nhand behind the whole thing. And I'll be damned if I can\nfigure out who Retinger is. So the idea is that, well, you get like influential people in media, business, politics, and you bring them together just to talk. To try to find common\nanswers or common questions. It's all very much sort of Western Europe angle, European, all very closely sort\nof connected to NATO, the whole concept of a\nkind of Atlanticist world, which is essentially the Anglo American combine\ncombined with Western Europe. But you got a bunch of these things. I mean, the Council on Foreign\nRelations is very similar to that and the Bilderbergers\nand there's an overlap with the Bohemian Club. And then you've got the\nPinay Circle or Le Cercle, which is more military, but also linked to the so-called secret... You know, of the idea of the Soviets over around Western Europe, there would be a stay behind organization called Gladio, there'd be these freedom fighters. So the question I have about that is that how many secret\norganizations do you need? I mean, why all these separate groups, which often seem to have\nthe same people into them? - Yeah, there's a, I\nmean, the closer I look, the more I wonder the\nsame question we asked about the Russian intelligence agencies is where is the center of power? It seems to be very hard to figure out. Does the secrecy scare you? - Well, I guess on one level, I'm comforted that there's\nsomebody actually making decisions, as opposed to... I mean, what do you want? Do you want chaos or do\nyou want everything kind of rigidly controlled? And I don't put much stock in the idea that there actually is some small group of people running everything\nbecause if they were, it would operate more efficiently. I do think that there are\nvarious disparate groups of people who think that they're\nrunning things or try to. And that's what concerns\nme more than anything else. Well, I hate to go back to them again, 'cause we have to bring it\nup, you go back to the Nazis, they had their whole idea\nabout a new world order and they only had 12 years to do it. Look what a mess they made. I mean, look at the damage, the physical damage that can\nbe done by an idea inspiring a relatively small group\nof people controlling a nation, based upon some sort of racial or ideological fantasy that\nhas no real basis in reality and yet guides their actions. It's this differentiation\nthat I always make and I would try to get across to students between always be clear\nabout what you know and what you believe. You don't know many things. You know your name, you\nknow when you were born, you probably know who your father is, but that's not absolute\nunless you've had a DNA test and only if you trust DNA tests. So you know who your mother is, you believe this man is your father. Why? Because your mother told you he was. So you believe things\ngenerally because someone has told you this is to be true, but you don't really know for sure. Well, because we know so little,\nwe tend to go by beliefs. So we believe in this, we\nbelieve in that, you know, you believe that your cult leader is the answer to everything. And it seems to be very, very easy to get people to believe things. And then what happens is that whether or not those\nbeliefs have any real basis in reality, they begin to\ninfluence your actions. So here again, regrettably\nin some ways to bring it back to the Nazis, what were\nthe Nazis convinced of? They were convinced that Jews\nwere basically evil aliens. That's what it comes down to.\nThey weren't really humans. There's some sort of evil contamination which we must eradicate. And they set out to do that. - And they were sure that\nthere's just a few problems that can be solved. And once you solve them, that you have this beautiful utopia where everything would be just perfect. It would be great. And\nwe can just get there. And I think this really strong\nbelief in a global utopia, it just never goes right. It seems like impossible to know- - For some reason, not long ago, I was listening on YouTube\nto old Wobbly songs. - Okay. (laughs) - The Workers of the\nWorld. I don't know why. I didn't know there was a\nwhole album of Wobbly songs. And there was one of them\ncalled \"Commonwealth of Toil.\" And like most of them,\nthey're sort of taken from gospel songs. And it's talking about in the future, how wonderful everything\nwill be in the commonwealth of toil that will be. And now these are revolutionary leftists, in this case, Wobblies. But nonetheless, it's like\na prayer for communism. In the future, everything will be good because the Earth will\nbe shared by the toilers and from each of his\nabilities to each according to his need. And it's this kind of sweet\nlittle song in some way. But I'm just sort of imagining this. If I was going to stage that, I'd have like this choir\nof children singing it with a huge hammer and sickle behind them, because that's what it's combining. And you can think that the\nsentiments that are expressed in that song, which,\nyou know, are legitimate in some way, of all the horrors\nthat that then leads to. - It is fascinating about\nhumans, a beautiful idea on paper, an innocent little idea about a utopian future can\nlead to so much suffering and so much destruction. And the unintended\nconsequences that you see- - All have unintended consequences. - And we learn from it. I mean, that's why history is important. We learn from it, hopefully. - Do we?\n- (laughs) Slowly. We are slow learners. - I'm unconvinced of that, but perhaps is. - Speaking of unconvinced,\nwhat gives you hope? If human beings are still here, maybe expanding out into the cosmos 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 years from now, what gives you hope about that future, about even being a possible\nfuture, about it happening? - Most people are cooperative\nand kind most of the time. And that's one of those things that can usually be\ndepended upon, you know? And usually you'll get back\nto what you put into it. Another thing that I have\nlike a weird fascination of watching are people who have meltdowns on airplanes, because that's just bizarre. - That's fascinating to watch, yeah. - The people who will, you know, there's some sort of\npsychotic break that occurs and it's always going to end the same way. The cops are going to come on\nand drag you off the plane. And you're going to\ninconvenience everybody there. And usually at some point\nthey don't care about that. That's the one little sense\nof power that they have. So they have some sort of\nsense of powerlessness. And if their only way of power is just to piss off everybody else on that plane, they're going to go ahead and do it, even though it's going\nto lead nowhere for them. - And there's similar, sometimes, psychological behavior in traffic. - Oh, the road rage thing.\n- The road rage, yeah. It's fascinating. - And I bet that most, there again, those are all people who up to some point were cooperative\nand kind and polite, and then they snap. So those are all part of\nthe human makeup as well. - But also part of the human makeup, difference between humans\nand chimps is the ability to get together, cooperate on a mass scale over an idea, create things\nlike the Roman Empire did, laws that prevent us and protect us from crazy human behavior, manifestations of a Manson type- - Well, human beings\nare just weird animals. Not kidding around. They're\njust completely peculiar. I'm not sure that we're\nall-together natural. - But I think we are\nall-together beautiful. There is something magical about humans, and I hope humans stay here, even as we get advanced robots\nwalking around everywhere, more and more intelligent\nrobots that claim to have consciousness,\nthat claim they love you, that increasingly take over our world, I hope this magical things that makes us human still persists. - Well, let us hope so. - Rick, you're an incredible person. - Well, thank you. - You've done so much fascinating work, and it's really an honor. - I've never had anybody ask me as many interesting questions as you have. So... - Thank you so much.\n- Or as many questions. - (laughs) This was so fun. Thank you so much for talking today. - Well, thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Rick Spence. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from John F. Kennedy. \"The very word, secrecy, is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed\nto secret societies, to secret oaths, and\nto secret proceedings. We decided long ago that\nthe dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far\noutweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.\" Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time."
