  "full_text": "- The big question for\nme in that timeline is, why didn't we do it sooner? Why did it take so long? Why did we wait until\nafter 12,000 years ago, really, after 10,000 years ago to start seeing the\nbeginnings of civilization? - The following is a\nconversation with Graham Hancock, a journalist and author, who for over 30 years has explored the controversial possibility that there existed a lost civilization during the last Ice Age, and that it was destroyed\nin a global cataclysm some 12,000 years ago. He is the presenter of the\nNetflix documentary series, \"Ancient Apocalypse\", the second season of which\nhas just been released, and it's focused on the\ndistant past of the Americas, a topic I recently discussed\nwith the archeologist, Ed Barnhart. Let me say that Ed represents the kind of archeologist, scholar I love talking to on the podcast. Extremely knowledgeable, humble, open-minded, and\nrespectful in disagreement. I'll do many more podcasts on history, including ancient history. Our distant past is full of mysteries, and I find it truly exciting to explore those mysteries with people, both on the inside and the\noutside of the mainstream, in the various disciplines involved. This is a Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Graham Hancock. Let's start with a big foundational idea that you have about human history, that there was an advanced\nIce Age civilization that came before and perhaps\nceded what people now call the sixth cradles of civilization, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India,\nChina, Andes, and Mesoamerica. So let's talk about\nthis idea that you have. Can you, at the highest\npossible level, describe it? - It would be better to describe it as a foundational sense of\npuzzlement and incompleteness in the story that we are\ntaught about our past, which envisages more or less, there have been a few ups and downs, but more or less a straightforward\nevolutionary progress. We start out as hunter foragers, then we become agriculturalists. The hunter forger phase could go back hundreds of thousands of years. I mean, this is where it is\nalso important to mention that anatomically modern humans, and were not the only humans. We had Neanderthals from, I\ndon't know, 400,000 years ago to about 40,000 years ago. They were certainly human because anatomically modern\nhumans interbred with them, and we carry Neanderthal genes. There were the Denisovans maybe 300,000 to perhaps even as recently\nas 30,000 years ago. And again, interbreeding took place. They're obviously a human species. So, you know, we've got\nthis background of humans who didn't look quite like us. And then we have\nanatomically modern humans. And I think the earliest anatomically modern human skeletal remains are from Jebel Irhoud in Morocco, and date to about 310,000 years ago. So the question is, what were our ancestors doing after that? And I think we can\ninclude the Neanderthals and that Denisovans in\nthat general picture. And why did it take so long? This is one of the puzzles, one of the questions that bother me. Why did it take so long when we have creatures who are\nphysically identical to us, we cannot actually weigh\nand measure their brains. But from the work that's\nbeen done on the crania, it looks like they had\nthe same brains that we do with the same wiring. So if we've been around for\n300,000 plus years at least, and if ultimately in our\nfuture was the process to create civilization or civilizations, why didn't it happen sooner? Why did it take so long? Why was it such a long time? Even the story of\nanatomically modern humans has kept on changing. I remember a time when it was said that there hadn't been\nanatomically modern humans before 50,000 years ago. And then it became 196,000 years ago with the findings in Ethiopia,\nand then 310,000 years ago. There's a lot of missing\npieces in the puzzle there. But the big question\nfor me in that timeline is why didn't we do it sooner? Why did it take so long? Why did we wait until\nafter 12,000 years ago, really after 10,000 years ago, to start seeing the beginnings, what are selected as the\nbeginnings of civilization in places like Turkey, for example. And then there's a relatively slow process of adopting agriculture. And by 6,000 years ago,\nwe see Ancient Sumer emerging as a civilization. And we're then in the predynastic period in Ancient Egypt as well, 6,000 years ago, beginning to see definite\nsigns of what will become the dynastic civilization of\nEgypt about 5,000 years ago. And interestingly round\nabout the same time, you have the Indus Valley Civilization popping up out of nowhere. And by the way, the\nIndus Valley Civilization was a lost civilization until the 1920s when railway workers accidentally stumbled across some ruins. I've been to Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, and these are extraordinarily beautifully centrally-planned cities. Clearly they're the work of an already sophisticated civilization. One of the things that strikes me about the Indus Valley Civilization is that we find a steatite\nseal of an individual seated in a recognizable yoga posture. And that seal is 5,000 years old, and the yoga posture is Mulabandhasana, which involves a real\ncontortion of the ankles and twisting the feet back. It's an advanced yoga posture. So there it is, 5,000 years ago, and that then raises the question, well, how long did yoga\ntake to get to that place when it was already so\nadvanced 5,000 years ago? What's the background to this? China, the Yellow River Civilization, again, it's around about the same period, five to 6,000 years ago. You get these first signs\nof something happening. So it's very odd that\nall around the world, we have this sudden\nupsurge of civilization about 6,000 years ago, preceded by what seems like a\nnatural evolutionary process that would lead to a civilization. And yet certain ideas being carried down and manifested and expressed in many of these different civilizations. I just find that whole idea very puzzling and very disturbing, especially when I look\nat this radical break that takes place in not\njust the human story, but the story of all life on Earth, which was the last great cataclysm that the Earth went through, which was the Younger Dryas event. It was an extinction level event. That's when all the great megafauna of the Ice Age went extinct. It's after that event\nthat we start seeing this, what are taken to be the beginnings of the first gradual steps\ntowards civilization. We come out of the upper\nPaleolithic, as it's defined, the end of the old Stone\nAge and into the Neolithic. And that's when the wheels\nare supposedly set in motion to start civilization rolling. But what happened before that, and why did that suddenly happen then? And I can't help feeling, and I felt this for a very long while, that there are major\nmissing pieces in our story. It's often said that I'm\nclaiming to have proved that there was an advanced lost\ncivilization in the Ice Age. And I am not claiming to have proved that. That is a hypothesis\nthat I am putting forward to answer some of the\nquestions that I have about prehistory. And I think it's worthwhile to inquire into those possibilities, because the Younger Dryas event was a massive global\ncataclysm, whatever caused it. And it's strange that just after it, we start seeing these first signs. - So the current understanding\nin mainstream archeology is that after the Younger Dryas is when the civilizations popped up in different places of the globe, with a lot of similarities, but they popped up independently. - Yeah, independently, and by coincidence. And by coincidence,\nthose big civilizations that we all remember as\nthe first civilizations, Sumer, Egypt, the Indus\nValley Civilization, China, they all pop up at the\npretty much the same time. That is the mainstream view. - And they don't just pop up, they kind of build up gradually. First, there's some settlements. - Oh, definitely, yes. - And then there's different\ndynamics of how they build up and the role of agriculture, and that is also non-obvious, but it's just, there's\nfirst a kind of settlement, a stabilization of where\nthe people are living. Then they start using agriculture, then they start getting urban centers and that kind of stuff. - It seems like an entirely\nreasonable argument. Everything about that makes sense. There is no doubt that you're\nseeing evolutionary progress, social evolution taking place in those thousands of\nyears before Sumer emerges. But what's happening now, really, I spent much of\nthe '90s and the late 1980s investigating this issue\nof a lost civilization. I wrote a series of books about it. But by 2002, when I published\na book called \"Underworld\", which was the most massive\nand most heavy book that I've ever written, because I was writing very\ndefensively at the time. By the time I finished that\nbook, my wife, Santha, and I spent seven years scuba\ndiving all around the world, looking for structures underwater, often led by local\nfishermen or local divers to anomalies that they'd seen underwater. By the time that book\nwas finished, I thought, actually, I've done this story. I've walked the walk. I really don't have much\nmore to say about it. And I turned in another direction and I wrote a book called, \"Supernatural: Meetings\n\"with the Ancient Teachers \"of Mankind\", recently\nretitled \"Visionary\". And that was about the role of, fundamentally about the\nrole of psychedelics in the evolution of human culture. And I didn't think that I would go back to the lost civilization issue, but Göbekli Tepe in Turkey\nkept on forcing itself upon me. The more and more discoveries there, the 11,600 year date from Enclosure D, which is the two largest\nmegalithic pillars. And I reached a point where I realized, I have to get back in the water, and I have to investigate this again. And Göbekli Tepe was a game changer. But I think it's a game\nchanger for everything, because Göbekli Tepe, the\nextraordinary nature of it, we are looking at a major megalithic site, which is at least five\nand a half thousand years older than say, Ggantija in Malta, which is, was previously considered to be the oldest megalithic\nsite in the world. And this led, of course, to a huge amount of\ninterest and attention, both from the Turkish government who see the potential tourism potential of having the world's\noldest megalithic site, and from archeologists. And this in turn has led to exploration and excavation throughout the region. And what they're finding\nthroughout that whole region around Göbekli Tepe, and\ngoing down into Syria, and further down into the\nJordan Valley as far as Jericho, and even across a bit of the\nMediterranean into Cyprus, is what Turkish\narcheologists are now calling the Taş Tepeler Civilization. They're calling it a civilization, the Stone Hills Civilization, with very definite\nidentifying characteristics, semi-subterranean, circular structures, the use of T-shaped megalithic pillars, sometimes not anywhere near as\nbig as those at Göbekli Tepe. It's clear that Göbekli Tepe now was not the beginning of this process. It was actually in a way,\nthe end of this process. It was the summation of everything that Stone Hills\nCivilization had achieved. But what is becoming clear\nis that this is a period between before the\nfoundation of Göbekli Tepe, as far as we know, that\ndate of 11,600 years ago is the oldest date for Göbekli Tepe. But of course, there's\na lot of Göbekli Tepe still underground. So we can't say for sure\nthat that's the oldest, but it's the oldest so far excavated. What we're seeing is that in\nthat whole region around there, there was something was in motion, and it began to go into motion round about the beginning\nof the Younger Dryas. And this is where these two\ndates are really important. The Younger Dryas, I'll\nround the figures off, begins around 12,800 years ago, and it ends around 11,600 years ago. So Göbekli Tepe's construction date, if it is 11,600 years ago, if they don't find older materials, marks the end of the Younger Dryas. But the beginning of the Younger Dryas, we are already seeing the\nstirrings of the kind of culture that manifests in full\nform at Göbekli Tepe. And after the construction\nof Göbekli Tepe, in fact, even during the\nconstruction of Göbekli Tepe, we see agriculture\nbeginning to be adopted. The people who created Göbekli\nTepe were all hunter foragers at the beginning, but by the time Göbekli Tepe was finished, and it was definitely\ndeliberately finished, closed off, closed down,\ndeliberately buried, covered with earth, covered with rubble, and then topped off with a hill, which is why Göbekli Tepe\nis called what it is. Göbekli Tepe means Potbellied Hill, or the Hill of the Navel. For a long time, Göbekli Tepe was thought to be just a hill that\nlooked a bit like a potbelly. - Can you say how it was discovered? I think this is one of the most fascinating things on Earth, period. So maybe can you say what it\nis and how it was discovered. - Well, Göbekli Tepe is first of all, the oldest fully elaborated\nmegalithic site that we know of anywhere in the world. It doesn't mean that\nolder ones won't be found, but it is the oldest so far found. The part of the site\nthat's been excavated, which is a tiny percentage\nof the whole site. We do know, my first visit\nto Göbekli Tepe was in 2013, and Dr. Klaus Schmidt, the\nlate Dr. Klaus Schmidt, who died a year later, was very generous to me and\nshowed me around the site for over a period of three days. And he explained to me that they've already used\nground penetrating radar on the site, and they know that there's\nmuch more Göbekli Tepe still underground. So anything is possible in terms of the dating of Göbekli Tepe. But what we have at the moment is a series of almost circular, but not quite circular enclosures, which are walled with\nrelatively small stones. And then inside them you have\npairs of megalithic pillars. And the archetypal part of\nthat site is Enclosure D, which contains the two\nlargest upright megaliths, about 18 feet tall. and reckoned to weigh somewhere\nin the range of 20 tons, if I have my memory correct. They're substantial,\nhefty pieces of stone. It isn't some kind of extraordinary feat to create a 20 foot\ntall or 20 ton megalith, nor is it an extraordinary\nfeat to move it. There's nothing magical or\nreally weird about that. Human beings can do that and always have. Besides the quarry for the\nmegaliths is right there. It's within 200 meters\nof the main enclosure. So that's not a mystery. But the mystery is why suddenly this new form of architecture, this massive, massive\nmegalithic pillars appear. And the pillars, one of the\nthings that interests me about the pillars is their alignment. And there is good work that's been done, which suggests that Enclosure D aligns to the rising of the star, Sirius. And the rising points of the star, Sirius, appear to be mapped by\nthe other enclosures, which are all oriented in\nslightly different directions. It was the work entirely\nof hunter foragers, but by the time Göbekli\nTepe was completed, agriculture was being introduced, and was taking place there. Now you asked how Göbekli Tepe was found. The answer to that is that there was a survey\nof that Potbellied Hill in the 1960s by some\nAmerican archeologists, and they were looking, absolutely looking for Stone Age material, material from the paleolithic. And they had found some\npaleolithic flints, upper paleolithic flints around there. So it looked like a good place to look. But then they noticed sticking\nout of the side of the hill, some very finely cut stone, bits of very large and\nvery finely cut stone. And looking at that, the\nworkmanship was so good that those archeologists were confident that it had nothing to\ndo with the Stone Age. And they thought they were looking at perhaps some Byzantine remains, and they abandoned the site\nand never looked at it further. And it wasn't until the\nGerman Archeological Institute got involved and, but\nparticularly Klaus Schmidt, who I think was a genius,\nhad real insight into this, and started to dig at Göbekli Tepe, that they realized what they'd found, that they'd found potentially the oldest megalithic site in the world. And they'd found it at a\nplace where agriculture, according to the established\nhistorical timeline, that's where agriculture, at any rate, in Europe and Western Asia begins, it begins in Anatolia in Turkey, and then it gradually\ndisseminates westward from there. - And yet the understanding is it was created by hunter gatherers. - It was created by\nhunter gatherers, yeah. There was no agriculture 11,600\nyears ago in Göbekli Tepe. But by the time Göbekli\nTepe was decommissioned, and I use that word deliberately, was closed down and buried,\nagriculture was all around it. And this was agriculture of people who knew how to cultivate plants. - Do we have an understanding\nwhen it was turned into a, if I could say a time capsule, so protected by forming a mound around it? - [Graham] Yes. - Is it around that similar time? - It stood from roughly 11,600 years ago to about 10,400 years\nago, to about 8,400 BC. So around 1200 years it was there. And it continued to be\nelaborated as a site. And while it was being\nelaborated as a site, we see agriculture, I'm gonna\nuse the word being introduced. It had, there'd been no sign of it before, and suddenly it's there. And to me, that's another of the mysteries about Göbekli Tepe. And then with the new\nwork that's being done, we realized that it's part\nof a much wider phenomenon, which spreads across an enormous distance. And the puzzling thing is\nthat after Göbekli Tepe, there almost seems to be a decline. Things fall down again. And then we enter this long,\nslow process of the neolithic, thousands of years, gradual developments until we come to Ancient\nSumer and Mesopotamia. But agriculture has taken\na firm route by then. Actually, one other thing,\nI'll just say this in passing. When I talk about a lost civilization, introducing ideas to people, I'm often accused of stealing credit from the indigenous people who had those ideas in the first place. So I do find it slightly hypocritical that archeology is fully accepts that the idea of agriculture was introduced to Western\nEurope from Turkey, and that the Western Europeans\ndidn't invent agriculture. It was absolutely introduced\nby Anatolian farmers who traveled west. So the notion of dissemination of ideas perhaps shouldn't be so annoying\nto archeologists as it is. And perhaps we should also state, if we look at the entirety\nof history of hominids, humans or hominids have been explorers. I didn't even know this when\nI was preparing for this. - [Graham] Yeah. - [Lex] Looking at homoerectus. - [Graham] Yeah. - [Lex] 1.9 million years ago. - Absolutely.\n- Almost right away they spread out through the whole world. - [Graham] Yeah. - And we, homo sapiens, evolved from them. And we should also mention,\nsince we're talking about sort of controversial debates going on, as I understand, there's still debates about the dynamics of all\nthat was going on there, like we mentioned in Africa,\nthat it's the, you know, I think the current understanding, we didn't come from one\nparticular point of Africa, that there's multiple locations. - This is the out of Africa theory. I think it's more than a theory, it's really strongly evidenced. Why, because we are part\nof the Great Ape family, and it's an African family. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's no doubt that human beings, our deep origins are in Africa. But then there, as you rightly say, there were these very early\nmigrations out of Africa by species that are likely ancestral to anatomically modern humans, including definitely homo erectus, and the astonishingly distant\ntravels that they undertook. Yes, I think there is an urge\nto explore in all of humanity. I think there is an urge to find out what's around the next corner, what's over the brow of the next hill. And I think that goes very\ndeep into human character. And I think it was being manifested in those early adventures\nof people who left Africa and traveled all around the world. And then settling in\ndifferent parts of the world, I think a lot of anatomically\nmodern human evolution took place outside Africa as\nwell, not not only in Africa. - So I guess the general\npuzzlement that you're filled with is given that these\ncreatures explore and spread and try out different environments, why did it take hundreds of\nthousands of years for them to develop complicated\nsociety settlements? - That's the first big question. Why did it take so long? And that raises in my mind\na hypothesis, a possibility. Maybe it didn't take so long. Maybe things were happening that we haven't yet got hold\nof in the archeological record, which await to be discovered. And of course, there are\nhuge parts of the world that have not been studied\nat all by archeology. But the fact that huge parts of the world have not been studied at all\nby archeology is not on its own enough to suggest that\nwe're missing a chapter in the human story. The reason that I come to\nthat isn't only puzzlement about that 300,000 year gap. It's also to do with the fact that there's common iconography. There's common myths and traditions, and there's common spiritual ideas that are found all around the world. And they're found amongst cultures that are geographically\ndistant from one another, and that are also distant\nfrom one another in time. They don't necessarily\noccur at the same time. And this is where I think\nthat archeology is perhaps desperately needing a history of ideas as well as just a history of things. Because an idea can\nmanifest again and again throughout the human story, so that there are particular issues, for example, the notion of the afterlife, destiny of the soul. What happens to us when we die? And believe me, when you reach my age, that's something you do\nthink about what happens. I used to feel immortal\nwhen I was in my 40s, but now that I'm 74, I\ndefinitely know that I'm not. Well, it would be natural for human beings all around the world to\nhave that same feeling, that same idea. But why would they all decide that what happens to the soul after death is that it makes a leap to\nthe heavens, to the Milky Way, that it makes a journey\nalong the Milky Way, that there it is confronted by challenges, by monsters, by closed gates. The course of the life\nthat that person has lived will determine their destiny\nin that afterlife journey. And this idea, the path of souls, the Milky Way is called the path of souls. It's very strongly found in the Americas, right from South America through Mexico, through into North America. But it's also found in Ancient\nEgypt, in Ancient India, in Ancient Mesopotamia, the same idea. And I don't feel that\nthat can be a coincidence. I feel that what we are looking at is an inheritance of an idea, a legacy that's been passed\ndown from a remote common source to cultures all around the world. And then has taken on a life of its own within those cultures. So the remote common source would explain both the similarities and the differences in the expression of these ideas. The other thing, very puzzling thing, is this sequence of numbers that are a result of the\nprecession of the equinoxes. At least I think that's the\nbest theory to explain them. Here, I think it's\nimportant to pay tribute to the work of Giorgio de\nSantillana and Hertha von Dechend. Giorgio de Santillana was\nProfessor of History of Science actually at MIT, where you\nare based, back in the '60s. And Hertha von Dechend was Professor of the History of Science at Frankfurt University. And they wrote an\nimmense book in the 1960s called \"Hamlet's Mill\". And \"Hamlet's Mill\" differs very strongly from established opinion on the issue of the\nphenomenon of precession. And I'll explain what\nprecession is in a moment. Generally, it's held\nthat it was the Greeks who discovered the precession. And the dating on that\nis put back not very far, maybe 2,300 years ago or so. Santillana and von\nDechend are pointing out that knowledge of procession\nis much, much older than that, thousands of years older than that. And they do actually trace it. I think I'm quoting them\npretty much correctly, to some almost unbelievable\nancestor civilization. Reading that book was one\nof the several reasons that I got into this\nmystery in the first place. Okay, now, the procession\nof the equinoxes, to give it its full name, is results from the fact that our planet is the viewing platform from which we observe the stars. And our planet, of course,\nis rotating on its own axis at roughly a thousand miles\nan hour at the equator. But what's less obvious is that it's also wobbling on its axis. And that it, so if you imagine the extended North Pole of the\nEarth pointing up at the sky, in our time, it's pointing\nat the star, Polaris, and that is our pole star. But Polaris has not\nalways been the pole star, precisely because of this\nwobble on the axis of the Earth. Other stars have occupied\nthe pole position, and sometimes the extended\nNorth Pole of the Earth points at empty space. There is no pole star. That's one of the obvious results of the wobble on the Earth's axis. The other one is that there are 12 well-known constellations in our time, the 12 constellations of the zodiac that lie along what is referred\nto as the path of the sun. The Earth is orbiting the sun, and we are seeing what's behind it, what's in direct line\nwith the sun in our view. And the zodiacal constellations all lie along the path of the sun. So at different times of the year, the sun will rise against the background of a particular zodiacal constellation. Today, we live in the age of Pisces, and it's definitely not an accident that the early Christians\nused the fish as their symbol. This is another area where\nI differ from archeology. I think the constellations of the zodiac were recognized as such much\nearlier than we suppose. Anyway, to get to the point,\nthe key marker of the year, certainly in the northern hemisphere, was the Spring Equinox. This was, the question was, what constellation is\nrising behind the sun? What constellation is\nhousing the sun at dawn on the Spring Equinox? Right now, it's Pisces. In another 150 years or\nso, it'll be Aquarius. We do live in the dawning\nof the age of Aquarius. Back in the time of the\nlate Ancient Egyptians, it was Aries, going back to\nthe time of Ramses or before. Before that it was Taurus,\nand so on and so forth. It's backwards through the\nzodiac until 12,500 years ago, you come to the age of Leo, when the constellation\nof Leo houses the sun on the Spring Equinox. Now this process unfolds\nvery, very, very, very slowly. The whole cycle, and it is a cycle. It repeats itself roughly\nevery 26,000 years. Put a more exact figure\non it, 25,920 years. That may be a convention. Some scholars would would say\nit was a bit less than that, a bit more, but you're talking fractions. It's in that area, 25,920 years. And to observe it, you really need more\nthan one human lifetime, because it unfolds very, very slowly, at a rate of one degree every 72 years. And the parallel that I often give is hold your finger up to the\nhorizon, the distant horizon. The movement in one lifetime, in a period of 72 years is\nabout the width of your finger. It's not impossible to\nnotice in a lifetime, but it's difficult. You've gotta pass it on. And what seems to have happened is that some ancient culture, the culture that Santillana\nand von Dechend call some almost unbelievable ancestor culture, worked out the entire\nprocess of procession, and selected the key\nnumbers of procession, of which the most important number, the governing number is the number 72. But we also have numbers\nrelated to the number 72. 72 plus 36 is 108. 108 divided by two is 54. These numbers are also found in mythology all around the world. There were 72 conspirators who were involved in\nkilling the God of Cyrus in Ancient Egypt and nailing\nhim up in a wooden coffer and dumping him in the Nile. There are 432,000 in the Rigveda. 432,000 is a multiple of 72. And at Angkor in Cambodia, for example, you have the bridge to Angkor Thom. And on that bridge you\nhave figures on both sides, sculpted figures, which are\nholding the body of a serpent. That serpent is Vasuki. And what they're doing is\nthey're churning the milky ocean. It's the same metaphor\nof churning and turning that's defined in the\nstory of \"Hamlet's Mill\", of Amlodi's mill. There are 54 on each side. 54 plus 54 is 108. 108 to 72 plus 36. It's a precessional number, according to the work that\nSantillana and von Dechend did. And the fascination\nwith this number system and its discovery all around the world is one of the puzzles that intrigued me, and suggest to me that we are\nlooking at ancestral knowledge that was passed down, and probably was passed down from a specific single\ncommon source at one time, but then was spread out very,\nvery widely around the world. - So one of the defining ways that you approach the\nstudy of human history that I think contrast\nwith mainstream archeology is do you take this sort\nof astronomical symbolism and the relationship between humans and the\nstars very seriously. - I do, as I believe the ancients did. - I think it's important\nto sort of consider what humans would've\nthought about back then. Now we have a lot of distractions. We have social media, we can watch videos on\nYouTube and whatever. But back then, especially\nbefore sort of electricity, the stars is like, yeah, the\nsexiest thing to talk about. - There's no light pollution. - There's no light pollution, so there's-- - Humanity of the heavens. - Every single night, you're spending looking up at the stars. And you can imagine there's\na lot of sort of status value to be the guy who's very\ngood at studying the stars. - [Graham] Yeah. - And sort of the scientists of the day. And I'm sure there's going to\nbe these geniuses that emerge. - [Graham] Yeah. - They're able to do two things. One, tell stories about\nthe gods of whatever, based on the stars. And then also as we'll\nprobably talk about, use the stars practically\nfor navigation, for example. - Oh yeah, definitely. - And so like, it makes\nsense that the stars had a primal importance\nfor the ideas of the times, for the status, for\nreligious explorations. - It was an ever present reality. - [Lex] Yes. - And it was bright and it was brilliant. And it was full of lights. It's inconceivable that the ancients would not have paid attention to it. It was an overwhelming presence. And that's one of the reasons\nwhy I'm really confident that the constellations\nthat we now recognize as the constellations of the zodiac were recognized much earlier, because it's hard to miss when\nyou pay attention to the sky, that the sun over the\ncourse of the solar year, is month by month rising\nagainst the background of different constellations. And then there's a much longer process, the process of procession, which takes that journey backwards. And where we have a period of 2,160 years for each sign of the zodiac, I think it would've been hard for the ancients to have missed that. They might not have\nidentified the constellations in exactly the same way we do today. That may well be a Babylonian\nor Greek convention. But that the constellations were there, I think was very clear, and that they were special constellations, unlike other ones higher up in the sky, which were not on the path of the sun that people paid attention to. - Well, but detecting the\nprocession of the Equinox is hard because especially they don't\nhave any writing systems. They don't have any mathematical systems. So everything is told through words. - Yeah. Well, and they have, let's not underestimate oral traditions. The oral traditions, that's something we've\nlost in our culture today. One of the things that\nhappens with the written word is that you gradually lose your memory. Actually, there's a nice\nstory from Ancient Egypt about the God, Thoth, the god of wisdom, who is very proud of himself because he has invented writing. \"Look at this gift\", he says to mythical Pharaoh of that time, \"look at the gift that I am\ngiving humanity, writing. \"This is a wonderful thing. \"It'll enable you to preserve so much \"that you would otherwise lose.\" And the Pharaoh in this\nstory replies to him, \"No, you have not given\nus a wonderful gift. \"You have destroyed the art of memory. \"We will forget everything. \"Words will roam free around the world, \"not accompanied by any wise advice \"to set them into context.\" And actually, that's a\nvery interesting point. And we do know that cultures that still do have oral traditions are able to preserve information for very long periods of time. One thing I think is clear in any time, in any period of history is\nhuman beings love stories. we love great stories, and one way to preserve\ninformation is to encode it, embed it in a great story. And so carefully done that actually, it doesn't matter whether\nthe storyteller knows that they're passing on\nthat information or not. The story itself is the vehicle. And as long as it's repeated faithfully, the information contained\nwithin it will be passed on. And I do think this is part of the story of the preservation of knowledge. - So that's one of the reasons that you take myths seriously. - I take them very seriously,\nand the other many reasons. But I can't help being deeply\nimpressed and deeply puzzled by the worldwide tradition\nof a global cataclysm within human memory. I mean, we know that,\nwe know scientifically that there have been many,\nmany cataclysms in the past, going back millions of years. I mean, the best known one,\nof course is the KPG event as it's now called, that\nmade the dinosaurs extinct 65 million, or 66 million years ago. But has there been such a cataclysm in the lifetime of the human species? Yeah, the Mount Toba eruption\nabout 70,000 years ago was pretty bad. But a global cataclysm, the Younger Dryas really\nticks all the boxes as a worldwide disaster, which definitely involved sea level rise, both at the beginning and at\nthe end of the Younger Dryas. It definitely involved\nthe swallowing up of lands that previously had been above water. And I think it's an excellent candidate for this worldwide tradition\nof a global cataclysm, of which one of, but not the only distinguishing\ncharacteristics was a flood, an enormous flood, and\nthe submergence of lands that had previously been\nabove water, underwater. The fact that this story is\nfound all around the world suggests to me that the\narcheological explanation is, look, people suffer local\nfloods all the time. I mean, as we're talking,\nthere's flooding in Florida, but I don't think anybody in Florida is going to make the mistake of believing that that's a global flood. They know it's local. But that's the argument\nlargely of archeology dealing with the flood myths, or that some local population experienced a nasty local flooding event. And they decided to say that\nit affected the whole world. I'm not persuaded by that, particularly since we know\nthere was a nasty epoch, the Younger Dryas when flooding did occur, and when the Earth was subjected to events cataclysmic enough to extinguish entirely the megafauna of the Ice Age. - So there is the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis that provides an\nexplanation of what happened during this period. - Yeah. - That result in such\nrapid environmental change. So can you explain this hypothesis? - Yes. The Younger Dryas Impact\nHypothesis, YDIH for short, is not a lunatic fringe theory as its opponents often\nattempt to write it off. It's the work of more\nthan 60 major scientists working across many different disciplines, including archeology and\nincluding oceanography as well. And they are collectively puzzled by the sudden onset of the Younger Dryas. And by the fact that it is\naccompanied 12,800 years ago by a distinct layer in the earth. You can see it most\nclearly at Murray Springs in Arizona, for example. You can see it's about\nthe width of a human hand, and there's a draw there that's been cut by flash flooding at some time. And that draw has revealed\nthe sides of the draw, and you can see the cross section. And in the cross section\nis this distinct dark layer that runs through the earth, and it contains evidence of wildfires. There's a lot of soot in it. There are also nanodiamonds in it. There is shocked quartz in it. There is quartz that's\nbeen melted at temperatures in excess of 2,200 degrees Centigrade. There are carbon microspherials. All of these are proxies for\nsome kind of cosmic impact. I talked a moment ago about the\nextinction of the dinosaurs. Luis and Walter Alvarez, who made that incredible discovery, initially, their discovery\nwas based entirely on impact proxies, just\nas the Younger Dryas. There was no crater. And for a long time they were disbelieved because they couldn't produce a crater. But when they finally did produce that deeply buried Chicxulub crater, that's when people started to say, yeah, they have to be right. But they weren't relying on the crater, they were relying on the impact proxies. And they're the same impact proxies that we find in what's called the Younger Dryas boundary\nlayer all around the world. So it's the fact that at the moment when the Earth tips into\na radical climate shift, it's been warming up\nfor at least 2000 years before 12,800 years ago. People at the time must have been feeling a great sense of relief. You know, we've been living\nthrough this really cold time, but it's getting better. Things are getting better. And then suddenly around 12,800 years ago, some might say 12,860 years ago, there's a massive global\nplunge in global temperatures. And the world suddenly\ngets as cold as it was at the peak of the Ice Age. And it's almost literally overnight. It's very, very, very rapid. Normally in an epoch, when the\nEarth is going into a freeze, you would not expect sea levels to rise. But there is a sea level\nrise, a sudden one, right at the beginning\nof the Younger Dryas. And then you have this long frozen period from 12,800 to 11,600 years ago. And then equally dramatically\nand equally suddenly, the Younger Dryas comes to an end and the world very rapidly warms up. And you have a recognized\npulse of meltwater at that time as the last of a the galciers collapse into the sea, called Meltwater Pulse 1B,\nround about 11,600 years ago. So this is a period which\nis very tightly defined. It's a period when we know\nthat human populations were grievously disturbed. That's when the so-called\nClovis culture of North America vanished entirely from the\nrecord during the Younger Dryas. And it's the time when the mammoths and the saber-toothed tigers vanished from the record as well. - Is there a good understanding of what happened geologically, whether there was an impact or not? Like what explains this\nhuge dip in temperature and then rise in temperature? - The abrupt cessation of the global meridional\noverturning circulation, of which the Gulf Stream\nis the best known part. The main theory that's\nbeen put forward up to now, and I don't dispute that theory at all, is that the sudden freeze was caused by the cutting off of the\nGulf Stream, basically, which is part of the central\nheating system of our planet. So no wonder it became cold. But what's not really\nbeen addressed before is why that happened, why\nthe Gulf Stream was cut, why a sudden pulse of meltwater\nwent into the world ocean. And it was so much of\nit, and it was so cold, that actually stopped the\nGulf Stream in its tracks. And that's where the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis offers a very elegant and\nvery satisfactory solution to the problem. Now the hypothesis, of\ncourse, is broader than that. Amongst the scientists working\non it are, for example, Bill Napier, an\nastrophysicist, an astronomer. They have assembled a\ngreat deal of evidence, which suggests that the culprit in the Younger Dryas\nimpact event or events was what we now call the\nTaurid Meteor Stream, which the Earth still\npasses through twice a year. It's now about 30 million kilometers wide. Takes the Earth a couple of days to pass through it on its orbit. It passes through it in June, and it passes through it\nat the end of October. The suggestion is that\nthe Taurid Meteor Stream is the end product of a very large comet that entered the solar system\nround about 20,000 years ago, came in from the Oort cloud, got trapped by the gravity of the sun and went into orbit around the sun, an orbit that crossed\nthe orbit of the Earth. However, when it was one object, the likelihood of a\ncollision with the Earth was extremely small. But as it started to\ndo what all comets do, which was to break up\ninto multiple fragments, 'cause these are chunks of\nrock held together by ice. And as they warm up, they\nsplit and disintegrate and break into pieces. As it passed through that, its debris stream became larger and larger and wider and wider. And the theory is that 12,800 years ago, the Earth passed through\na particularly dense part of the Taurid Meteor Stream, and was hit by multiple\nimpacts all around the planet, certainly from the west of North America, as far east as Syria. And that we are by and large not talking about impacts\nthat would've caused craters, although there certainly were some, we are talking about airbursts. When an object is 100 or\n150 meters in diameter and it's coming in very fast\ninto the Earth's atmosphere, it is very unlikely to reach the Earth. It's gonna blow up in the sky. And the best known recent example of that is the Tunguska event in Siberia, which took place on\nthe 30th of June, 1908. The Tunguska event was nobody disputes, it was definitely an airburst\nof a cometary fragment. And the date is interesting, because the 30th of June is\nthe height of the Beta Taurid. It's one of the two times when the Earth is going through\nthe Taurid Meteor Stream. Well, luckily that part of\nSiberia wasn't inhabited, but 2000 square miles of\nforest were destroyed. If that had happened over a major city, we would all be thinking very hard about objects out of\nthe Taurid Meteor Stream and about the risk of cosmic impact. So the suggestion is that\nit wasn't one impact, it wasn't two impacts,\nit wasn't three impacts. It was hundreds of airbursts\nall around the planet, coupled with a number of bigger objects, which the scientists working on this think hit the North\nAmerican ice cap largely. Some of them may also have hit\nthe Northern European ice cap resulting in that sudden, otherwise unexplained, flooded meltwater that went into the world ocean, and caused the cooling\nthat then took place. But this was a disaster for\nlife all over the planet. And it's interesting that one of the sites where they find the Younger Dryas boundary and where they find overwhelming\nevidence of an airburst, and where they find\nall the shocked quartz, the carbon microspherials,\nthe nanodiamonds, the trinitite, and so on and so forth, all of those impact proxies\nare found at Abu Hureyra. That was a settlement within\n150 miles of Göbekli Tepe. And it was hit 12,800 years\nago, and it was obliterated. Interestingly, it was\nreinhabited by human beings within probably five years. But it was completely\nobliterated at that time. And it's difficult to imagine that the people who lived in that area would not have been very impressed by what they saw happening by these massive explosions in the sky and the obliteration of Abu Hureyra. Now this is a theory,\nthe Younger Dryas impact, it's a hypothesis actually. It's not even a theory. A theory is, I think,\nconsidered a higher level than a hypothesis. That's why it's the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis. And of course it has many opponents, and there are many who disagree with it. And there have been a series\nof peer-reviewed papers that have been published, supposedly debunking the\nYounger Dryas Impact Hypothesis. One I think was in 2011. It was called \"A Requiem for the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis\". And there's one just been\npublished a few months ago, or a year ago, you know, called, \"A Complete Refutation \"of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis\", something like that, some lengthy title. So it's a hypothesis\nthat has its opponents, and even within those of us who are looking at the\nalternative side of history, there are different points of view. Robert Schoch from Boston University, the geologist who demonstrated that the erosion on the Sphinx may well have been caused by exposure to a long period of very heavy rainfall. He doesn't go for the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis. He think, he fully accepts\nthat the Younger Dryas was a global cataclysm and that\nthe extinctions took place, but he thinks it was caused by some kind of massive solar outburst. So there, what everybody's agreed on is the Younger Dryas was bad, but there is dispute about what caused it. I personally have found the\nYounger Dryas Impact Hypothesis to be the most persuasive, which most effectively\nexplains all the evidence. - How important is the impact hypothesis, to your understanding of the Ice Age advanced civilizations? So is it possible to\nhave another explanation for environmental factors that could have erased most\nof an advanced civilization during this period? - In a sense, it's not\nthe impact hypothesis that is central to what I'm saying, it's the Younger Dryas that's\ncentral to what I'm saying. And the Younger Dryas required a trigger, something caused it. I think the Younger\nDryas Impact Hypothesis, the notion that we're\nlooking at a debris stream of a fragmenting comet, and we can still see that debris stream because it's still up there, and we still pass through it twice a year is the best explanation. But I don't mind other explanations. It's good that there\nare other explanations. The Younger Dryas is a big mystery, and it's not a mystery\nthat's been solved yet. And that word, advanced civilization, this is another word that\nis easily misunderstood. And I've tried to make\nclear many, many times that when we consider the possibility of something like a\ncivilization in the past, we shouldn't imagine that it's us, that it's something like us. We should expect it to be\ncompletely different from us, but that it would've\nachieved certain things. So amongst the clues that intrigue me are those precession numbers that are found all around the world, and are a category of ancient\nmaps called Portolanos, which suddenly started to appear just after the crusade\nthat entered Constantinople and sacked Constantinople. The Portolanos suddenly start to appear. And they're extremely accurate maps. The most of the ones that have survived are extremely accurate maps\nof the Mediterranean alone. But some of them show much wider areas. For example, on these\nPortolanos style maps, you do find a depiction of\nAntarctica again and again. And another thing that\nthese maps have in common is that many of the mapmakers state that they base their maps on multiple older source\nmaps, which have not survived. These maps are intriguing, because they have very\naccurate relative longitudes. Our civilization did not\ncrack the longitude problem until the mid 18th century\nwith Harrison's chronometer, which was able to keep\naccurate time at sea. So you could have the time in London, and you could have the local time at sea at the same time on, and then you could work\nout your longitude. There might be other ways of\nworking out longitude as well. But there it is. The fact is these Portolanos have extremely accurate\nrelative longitudes. Secondly, some of them\nshow the world, to my eye, as it looked during the Ice Age. They show a much extended\nIndonesia and Malaysian peninsula. And the series of islands\nthat make up Indonesia today are all grouped together\ninto one landmass. And that was the case during the Ice Age. That was the Sunda Shelf. And the presence of Antarctica\non some of these maps also puzzles and intrigues me, and is not satisfactorily explained in my view, by archeology, which says, oh, those mapmakers, they felt that the world\nneeded something underneath it to balance it. So they put a fictional landmass there. I don't think that makes sense. I think somebody was mapping the world during the last Ice Age, but that doesn't mean that\nthey had our kind of tech. It means that they were following\nthat exploration instinct, that they knew how to navigate. They'd been watching the stars for thousands of years before. They knew how to navigate, and they knew how to build seagoing ships. And they explored the world\nand they mapped the world. Those maps were made a\nvery, very long time ago. Some of them, I believe, were likely preserved in\nthe Library of Alexandria. I think even then they were\nbeing copied and recopied. We don't know exactly what happened to the Library of Alexandria\nexcept that it was destroyed. I suggest it's likely, this was during the period\nof the Roman Empire. I suggest it's likely\nthat some of those maps were taken out of the library\nand taken to Constantinople. And that's where they were\nliberated during the crusade and entered world culture again, and started to be copied and recopied. - So from this perspective, when we talk about advanced\nIce Age civilization, it could have been a relatively\nsmall group of people with a technology of their\nscholars of the stars and their expert seafaring navigators. - Yes, that's about as\nfar as I would take it. And when I say that, as I have said on a number of occasions that it had technology equivalent to ours in the 18th century, I'm referring specifically to the ability to calculate longitude. - [Lex] Yeah. - I'm not saying that they\nwere building steam engines. I don't see any evidence for that. - And perhaps some building\ntricks and skills of how to-- - Well, definitely, and this again, is where you\ncome to a series of mysteries which are perhaps best expressed on the Giza Plateau in Egypt\nwith the Three Great Pyramids, and the extraordinary megalithic temples that many people don't\npay much attention to on the Giza Plateau and\nthe Great Sphinx itself. This is an area of particular importance in understanding this issue. - Well can you actually\ndescribe the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids and what you find most mysterious and interesting about them? - Well, first of all, the astronomy. And here I must pay\ntribute to two individuals, actually three individuals in particular. One of them is John Anthony\nWest, passed away in 2018. He was the first person in our era to begin to wonder if\nthe Sphinx was much older than it had been. Actually, he got that\nidea from a philosopher called Schwaller de Lubicz,\nwho'd noticed what he thought was water erosion on\nthe body of the Sphinx. John West picked that up, and he was a great amateur\nEgyptologist himself. He spent most of his life in Egypt, and he was hugely versed in Ancient Egypt. And when he looked at the Sphinx and at the strange\nscalloped erosion patterns and the vertical fissures, particularly in the\ntrench around the Sphinx, he began to think maybe\nSchwaller was right. Maybe there was sign of\nsome sort of flooding here. And that's when he brought Robert Schoch, second person, I'd like to recognize. Geologists at Boston University. He brought Schoch to Giza, and Schoch was the first geologist to stick his neck out, risk\nthe ire of Egyptologists and say, well, it looks to me\nlike the Sphinx was exposed to at least a thousand\nyears of heavy rainfall. And as Schoch's\ncalculations have continued, as he's continued to be\nimmersed in this mystery, he's continuously pushed that back. And he's now, again, looking at the date of around 12,000, 12 and\na half thousand years ago during the Younger Dryas for the creation of the Great Sphinx. And then, of course, this is the period of the wet Sahara, the humid Sahara. The Sahara was a\ncompletely different place during the Ice Age. There were rivers in it,\nthere were lakes in it, it was fertile. It was possibly densely populated. And there was a lot of rain. There's not no rain in Giza today, but there's relatively little rain. The next person, not enough rain to cause that erosion\ndamage on the Sphinx. The next person who needs to\nbe mentioned in this context is Robert Bauval. Robert and I have co-authored\na number of books together. Unfortunately, Robert has been very ill for the last seven years. He's got a very bad chest infection. And I think also that Robert\nbecame very demoralized by the attacks of\nEgyptologists on his work. But Robert is the genius, and it does take a genius sometime to make these connections, 'cause nobody noticed it before that the Three Pyramids of Giza are laid out on the ground in the pattern of the three stars of Orion's Belt. And skeptics will say, well,\nyou can find any buildings and line them up with any stars you want. But Orion actually isn't\nany old constellation. Orion was the God of Cyrus in the sky. He was the Ancient Egyptians called the Orion constellation, Sahu. And they recognize it\nas the celestial image of the God of Cyrus. So what's being copied on the\nground is the belt of a deity, of a celestial deity. It's not just a random constellation. And then when we take\nprocession into account, you find something else\nvery intriguing happening. First of all, you find that the exact orientation of\nthe pyramids as it is today, and pretty much as it was when they're supposed to have\nbeen built 4,500 years ago, it's not precisely related\nto how Orion's Belt looked at that time. There's a bit of a twist\nis they're not quite right. But as you process the stars backwards, as you go back and back and back, and you come to around 10,500 BC, 12 and a half thousand years\nago, in the Younger Dryas, you find that suddenly\nthey locked perfectly. They match perfectly with the\nthree pyramids on the ground. And the same moment that the Great Sphinx, an Equinoctial monument aligned perfectly to the rising sun on the Spring Equinox. Anybody can contest\nthis through themselves. Just go to Giza on the 21st of\nMarch, be there before dawn, stand behind the Sphinx, and you will see the sun\nrising directly in line with the gaze of the Sphinx. But the question is, what constellation was behind the Sphinx? And 12 and a half thousand years ago, it was the constellation of Leo, and actually the constellation of Leo has a very sphinx-like look. And I and my colleagues are pretty sure that the Sphinx was\noriginally a lion entirely. And that it, over the thousands\nof years, it became damaged. It became eroded,\nparticularly the part of it that sticks out the head. There were periods when the Sphinx was completely covered in sand, but still the head stuck out. By the time you come to the fourth dynasty when the Great Pyramids\nare supposedly built, by the time you come\nto the fourth dynasty, the head of the lion, original lion head would've\nbeen a complete mess. And we suggest that it was then recarved into a Pharaonic head. Egyptologists think it\nwas the Pharaoh Khafre, but there's no real strong resemblance. But it's definitely\nwearing the Nemes headdress of an Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh. And we think that that's\na result of a re-carving of what was originally\nnot only a lion-bodied, but also a lion-headed monument. It wouldn't make sense if you\ncreate an Equinoctial marker in the time of Khafre 4,500 years ago, and the Sphinx is an Equinoctial marker. I mean, it's 270 feet\nlong and 70 feet high, and it's looking directly at\nthe rising sun on the Equinox. If you create it then,\nyou would be better, you'd be more likely to create\nit in the shape of a bull, because that was the age of Taurus when the constellation of Taurus housed the sun on the spring Equinox. So why is it a lion? And again, we think that's because of that observation of the skies, and putting on the ground\nas above, so below, putting on the ground an image of the sky at a particular time. Now, the fact that the Giza Plateau, it's a fact, of course that Egyptologists completely dispute. But the fact that the principle monuments of the Giza Plateau, the\nThree Great Pyramids, and the Great Sphinx\nall lock astronomically on the date of around 10,500 BC, to me, is most unlikely to be an accident. And actually, if you\nlook at computer software at the sky at that time, you'll see that the Milky\nWay is very prominent and seems to be mirrored on\nthe ground by the River Nile. I suggest that may be one\nof the reasons amongst many why Giza was chosen as the site\nfor this very special place. So the point I want to make is that an astronomical\ndesign on the ground, which memorializes a very ancient date, does not have to have been\ndone 12,500 years ago. If from the Ancient\nEgyptian point of view, you're there 4,500 years ago. And there's a time\n8,000 years before that, which is very, very,\nvery important to you. You could use astronomical language and megalithic architecture to memorialize that date\non the Giza Plateau, which is what we think we're looking at, except for one thing. And that's the erosion\npatterns on the Sphinx. And we are pretty sure\nthat the Sphinx at least does date back to 12 and\nhalf thousand years ago. And with it, the megalithic temples, the so-called Valley Temple, which stands just to the east and just to the south of the Sphinx, and the Sphinx Temple, which stands directly\nin front of the Sphinx. The Sphinx Temple has\nlargely been destroyed. But the Valley Temple attributed to Khafre on no good grounds whatsoever, is a huge megalithic construction, with blocks of limestone that weigh up to a hundred tons each. And yet it has been remodeled,\nrefaced with granite. There are granite blocks that are placed on top of the core limestone blocks. And those core limestone\nblocks were already eroded when the granite blocks were put there. Why? Because the granite blocks have actually been purposefully and deliberately cut to fit into the erosion marks on the, we believe much older\nmegalithic blocks there. So I think Giza is a\nvery complicated site. I would never seek to divorce\nthe dynastic Ancient Egyptians from the Great Pyramids. They were closely involved\nin the construction of the Great Pyramids\nas we see them today. But what I do suggest is that\nthere were very low platforms on the Giza Plateau that are much older, and that when we look at\nthe three Great Pyramids, we are looking at a\nrenovation and a restoration, and a enhancement of much older structures that had existed on the Giza Plateau for a much longer period before that. Actually the Great Pyramid is\nbuilt around a natural hill, and that natural hill might have been seen as the original primeval mound\nto the Ancient Egyptians. - So the idea is that the Sphinx was there long before the Pyramids, and the Pyramids were\nbuilt by the Egyptian to celebrate further\nan already holy place. - Yeah. And there were platforms in\nplace where the pyramids stand, not the pyramids as we see them today, but the base of those pyramids was already in place at that time. - So what's the case? What's the evidence that\nthe Egyptologists use to make the attributions that they do for the dating of the\nPyramids and the Sphinx? - Well, the Three Great Pyramids of Giza are different from later pyramids. This is another problem that\nI have with the whole thing is the story of pyramid building. When did it really begin? And the timeline that\nwe get from Egyptology is the first pyramid is the\npyramid of the Pharaoh Djoser. The Step Pyramid at Saqqara\nabout a hundred years or so before the Giza Pyramids are built. And then we have this\nexplosion in the fourth dynasty of true pyramids. We have three of them attributed\nto single Pharaoh Sneferu, who built supposedly the Pyramid at Meidum and the two pyramids at Dahshur, the Bent and the Red Pyramid. And then within that\nsame a hundred year span, we have the Giza Pyramids being built. This is according to\nthe Orthodox chronology. And then suddenly, once the\nGiza project is finished, pyramid building goes into a\nmassive slump in Ancient Egypt. And the pyramids of the fifth dynasty are, frankly speaking, a mess outside. They're very inferior constructions. You can hardly recognize\nthem as pyramids at all. But what happens when you go inside them is you find that they're\nextensively covered in hieroglyphs and imagery,\nrepeating the name of the king who was supposedly buried in that place. Whereas the Giza Pyramids have no internal inscriptions whatsoever. What we do have is one piece of graffiti about which there is some controversy. Basic statistics, it's a\n6 million ton structure. It's each side is about 750 feet long. - Yeah. - It's aligned almost perfectly\nto true north, east and west within three 60ths of a single degree, 60ths because degrees\nare divided into 60s. And it's the precision of the orientation and the absolute massive\nsize of the thing. Plus it's very complicated\ninternal passageways that are involved in it. You know, in the ninth century, the Great Pyramids still had\nits facing stones in place. But there was an Arab, Caliph Mamun, who had already realized\nthat other pyramids did have their entrances\nin the north face. Nobody knew where the entrance\nto the Great Pyramid was, but he figured, if there's\nan entrance to this thing, it's gonna be in the north face somewhere. So he put together a team of workers, and they went in with sledgehammers and they started smashing where he thought would be the entrance. And they cut their way\ninto the Great Pyramid for a distance of maybe a hundred feet. And then the hammering that\nthey did, dislodged something, they heard a little bit further\naway, something big falling. And they realized there\nwas a cavity there. And they started heading\nin that direction. And then they joined\nthe internal passageway of the Great Pyramid, the descending and the\nascending corridors that go up. When you go up the ascending corridor, every one of the internal\npassageways in the Great Pyramid that people can walk in, slopes\nat an angle of 26 degrees. That's interesting\nbecause the angle of slope of the exterior of the\nGreat Pyramid is 52 degrees. So we know mathematicians were\nat work as well as geometers in the creation of the Great Pyramid. If you go up the Grand Gallery, which is at the end of a\nso-called ascending corridor, and it's above the\nso-called Queen's Chamber. You go up the Grand Gallery, you're eventually going\nto come to what is known as the King's Chamber in\nwhich there is a sarcophagus. And that sarcophagus\nis a little bit too big to have been got in through the narrow entrance passage way. It's almost as though the\nso-called King's Chamber was built around the\nsarcophagus already in place. Above the King's Chamber\nare five other chambers. These are known as relieving chambers. The theory was that they were built to relieve the pressure\non the King's Chamber of the weight of the monument. But I think what makes that theory dubious is the fact that even lower down where more weight was involved, you have the Queen's Chamber, and there are no such\nrelieving chambers above that. In the top of these five chambers, a British adventurer and\nvandal called Howard Vyse, who dynamite his way into those\nchambers in the first place, allegedly found, well, he\nclaims he found the graffiti, a piece of graffiti left by a work gang, naming the Pharaoh Khufu. And it's true, I've been in that chamber, and there is the cartouche of Khufu there, quite recognizable. But the dispute around it is whether that is a\ngenuine piece of graffiti dating from the Old Kingdom, or whether Howard Vyse\nactually put it there himself, because he was in desperate\nneed of money at the time. I'm not sure what the\nanswer to that question is. Another reason why, but\nit's one of the reasons that Egyptologists feel\nconfident in saying that the pyramid is the work of Khufu. Another is what is called\nthe Wadi el-Jarf Papyri, where on the Red Sea, the diary of an individual\nKhan Merer was found. And he talks about bringing\nhighly polished limestone to the Great Pyramid. And it's clear that\nwhat he's talking about is the facing stones of the Great Pyramid. He's not talking about the\nbody of the Great Pyramid. He's talking about the facing\nstones of the Great Pyramid during the reign of Khufu. So that's another reason\nwhy the Great Pyramid is attributed to Khufu. But I think that Khufu\nwas undoubtedly involved in the Great Pyramid, and in a big way. But I think he was building upon and elaborating a much older structure. And I think the heart of that structure is the subterranean chamber, which is a 100 feet vertically beneath the base of the Great Pyramid. Anybody who suffers from claustrophobia will not enjoy being down there. You got to go down a 26\ndegree sloping corridor until a distance of about 300 feet. It's a hundred feet vertically, but the slope means you're\ngonna walk at a distance, not walk, you're gonna ape walk, you are almost gonna have to crawl. I've learned from long experience that the best way to\ngo down these corridors is actually backwards. If you go forward, you keep\nbumping your head on them, 'cause they're only three\nfeet, five inches high. You get down to the bottom, you have a short horizontal passage, and then you get into\nthe subterranean chamber. The theory of Egyptology is that this was supposed to\nbe the burial place of Khufu. But after cutting out that 300 foot long, 26 degree sloping passage, lot of which passes through bedrock, and having cut the subterranean\nchamber out of bedrock, gone to all that trouble, they decided they wouldn't bury him there. And they built what's now known as the Queen's Chamber\nas his burial chamber. But then they decided\nthat wouldn't do either, so they then built the King's Chamber, and that's where the Pharaoh is supposed to have been buried. Those Arab raiders under Caliph Mamun didn't find anything in\nthe Great Pyramid at all. - So your idea is that the Sphinx and maybe some aspects of the\nPyramid were much earlier. And why that's important,\nis it in that case, it would be evidence of\nsome transfer of technology. - Yes. - From a much older civilization. The idea is that during the Younger Dryas, most of that civilization was\neither destroyed or damaged, and they desperately\nscattered across the globe. - Seeking refuge. - Seeking refuge and\ntelling stories of maybe, one, the importance of the stars. Their knowledge about the stars. - [Graham] Yeah. - And their knowledge about building, and knowledge about navigation. - That's roughly the idea. So it's interesting that\nthe Ancient Egyptians have a notion of an epoch\nthat they call Zep Tepi, which is the first time,\nit means the first time. This is when the Gods walk the Earth. This is when Seven Sages\nbrought wisdom to Ancient Egypt. And that is seen as the origin of Ancient Egyptian civilization. There are king lists in by the\nAncient Egyptians themselves. There are king lists that go back way beyond the first dynasty, go back 30,000 years into\nthe past in Ancient Egypt, considered to be entirely\nmythical by Egyptologists. But nevertheless, it's interesting that there's that\nreference to remote time. Now, what you also have in Egypt are what might almost be\ndescribed as secret societies. The followers of Horace are one of those specifically tasked with bringing forward the knowledge from the first\ntime into later periods. The Souls of Peiennecken are another one of these mysterious secret society groups who are possessors of knowledge that they transmit to the future. And what I'm broadly suggesting is that those survivors of\nthe Younger Dryas cataclysm who settled in Giza, may have been relatively small in number. It's interesting that they're referred to in the Edfu Building text as Seven Sages, 'cause that repeats again and again. It's also in Mesopotamia, it's\nSeven Sages, seven Apkallu, who come out of the\nwaters of the Persian Gulf and teach people all the\nskills of agriculture and of architecture and of astronomy. It's found all around the world that there was a relatively\nsmall number of people who took refuge in Giza, who benefited from the survival skills of the hunter foragers who lived at Giza at that time, and who also passed on their knowledge to those hunter foragers. But it was not knowledge that\nwas ready to be put into shape at that time. And that knowledge was then preserved and kept and handled within\nvery secretive groups that passed it down\nover thousands of years. And finally it bursts into full form in the fourth dynasty in Ancient Egypt. And you know, the notion that\nknowledge might be transferred over thousands of years\nshouldn't be observed. We know, for example, in\nthe case of Ancient Israel, it goes back to the time of Abraham, which is pretty much,\nI think around 2000 BC, and knowledge has been\npreserved from that time right up to the present day. So if you can preserve\nknowledge for 4,000 years, you can probably preserve it for eight. - Now, of course the air\nbars on this are quite large, but if an advanced Ice\nAge civilization existed, where do you think it was? Where do you think we might\nfind it one day if it existed? And how big do you think\nit might have been? - Well, this is where I'm often accused of presenting a God of the gaps argument. And I think there was a lost civilization because there's lots of the Earth that archeologists have never looked at. Of course, I'm not thinking that. These are very special gaps\nthat I'm interested in, and I'm interested in them\nbecause of all the curiosities and the puzzlement that I've\nexpressed to you before. It's not just because there are gaps in the archeological record, it's because those gaps involve places that were very interesting places to live during the Ice Age. And they specifically\ninclude the Sahara Desert, which was not a desert during the Ice Age, and went through this warm wet period when it was very, very fertile. Certainly some archeology\nhas been done in the Sahara, but it's fractional, it's tiny. And I think if we want\nto get into the origins, the true origins, Ancient\nEgyptian civilization of the peoples of Ancient Egypt, we need to be looking\nin the Sahara for that. And the Amazon Rainforest\nis another example of this. I think the Sahara is about\n9 million square kilometers. The Amazon that's left under\ndense canopy rainforest is about 5 million square\nkilometers, maybe closer to six. And then you have the continental shelves that were submerged by sea level rise at the end of the Ice Age. Now it's well established that\nsea level rose by 400 feet, but it didn't rise by 400 feet overnight. It came in dribs and drabs. There were periods of very rapid, quite significant sea level rise. And there were periods when\nthe sea level was rising much more slowly. So that 400 foot sea\nlevel rise is spread out over a period of about 10,000 years. But there are episodes within it, like Meltwater Pulse 1B,\nlike Meltwater Pulse 1A when the flooding was really immense. - How big do you think it might have been, and do you think it was\nspread across the globe? So if there were expert navigators, do you think they spread across the globe? - Well, the reason that\nI'm talking about the gaps is I don't know where\nthis civilization started or where it was based. All I'm seeing are clues\nand mysteries and puzzles that intrigue me, and which suggest to me that something is missing from our past. And I'm not inclined to look\nfor that missing something in, for example, Northern Europe, because Northern Europe\nwas not a very nice place to live during the Ice Age. I mean, nobody smart\nwould build a civilization in Northern Europe 12,000 years ago. It was a hideous, frozen wasteland. The places to look are places that were\nhospitable and welcoming to human beings during the Ice Age. And that of course includes the coastlines that are now underwater. Of course, it includes the Sahara Desert, and of course it includes the\nAmazon Rainforest as well. All of these places, I\nthink, are candidates, for quote unquote, my lost civilization. And because I think largely\nfrom those ancient maps that it was a navigating\nseafaring civilization, I suspect that it wasn't\nonly in one place, it was probably in a number of places. And then I can only speculate. Maybe there was a cultural\nvalue where it was felt that it was not appropriate to interfere with the lives of hunter\nforagers at that time. Maybe it was felt that they should keep\ntheir distance from them, just as even today, there is a feeling that we\nshouldn't be interfering too much with the uncontacted tribes\nin the Amazon Rainforest. Although interestingly,\nsome of those tribes are now using cell phones. - Yeah. - That possibility may have\nbeen there in the past. And only when we come\nto a global cataclysm, does it become essential to have outreach and actually to take refuge amongst those hunter forager populations. That is the hypothesis that\nI'm putting it forward. I'm not claiming that it's a fact, but for me, it helps to\nexplain the evidence. - So that speaks to one of the challenges that archeologists provide to this idea is that there is a lot of evidence. - [Graham] Yeah. - Of humans in the Ice Age, and they appear to be\nall hunter gatherers. But like you said, only\na small percent of areas where humans have lived have\nbeen studied by archeologists. - That's right. Very tiny percent. And even a tiny percent of\nevery archeological site has been studied by archeologists too. Typically one to 5% of any\narcheological site is excavated. - I mean, that's why go back to the type it fills my mind with imagination, especially seeing as the time capsule. You know, it's almost certain that there is places on\nEarth we haven't discovered, that once we do, even if\nit's after the Ice Age, will change our view of human history. - [Graham] Yeah. - Do you think there's\ngoing to be a place, like what would be your\ndream thing to discover, like Göbekli Tepe, that says a definitive like perturbation to our understanding of Ice Age history. - Some kind of archive, some\nkind of hall of records. There's both mystical associations with the Hall of Records at Giza, from people like the\nEdgar Cayce organization. There's also Ancient Egyptian traditions, which suggest that something was concealed beneath the Sphinx. This is not an idea that\nis alien to Ancient Egypt, it's quite present in Ancient Egypt. So far as far as I know, nobody has dug down beneath the Sphinx. And of course there's very\ngood reasons for that. You don't wanna damage the place too much. But let's call it the Hall of Records, I'd love to find that. But I think in a way,\nthat's what Göbekli Tepe is. Göbekli Tepe is a hall of records. You know, it's interesting that just as I've tried to outline, I hope reasonably clearly, that the Three Great Pyramids of Giza match Orion's Belt in 10,500 BC, just as the Sphinx\nmatches Leo in 10,500 BC, 12,500 years ago or so, Pillar 43 in Enclosure D at Göbekli Tepe contains what a number of\nresearchers, myself included, regard as an astronomical diagram. Martin Sweatman of Edinburgh\nUniversity has brought forward the best work in this field. But it was initially\nstarted by a gentleman called Paul Burley, who noticed that one of\nthe figures on Pillar 43 is a scorpion, very much like we represent the constellation of Scorpio today. And that above it is a vulture\nwith outstretched wings, which is in a posture very\nsimilar to the constellation that we call Sagittarius. And on that outstretched\nwing is a circular object. And the suggestion is\nthat it's marking the time when the sun was at the\ncenter of the dark rift in the Milky Way at the Summer Solstice, 12 and a half thousand years ago. That's what it's marking. And it's interesting that the same date can be deduced from Pillar 40. Of course it's controversial. Martin Sweatman ideas are by no means accepted by archeology. But he's done very, very thorough detail statistical work on this,\nand I'm personally convinced. So we have a time capsule at Göbekli Tepe, which is memorializing a date\nthat is at least 1,200 years before Göbekli Tepe was built, if that dating of 11,600 years ago proves to be absolutely the\noldest date as it is at present. The date memorialized on\nPillar 43 is 12,800 years ago, the beginning of the Younger Dryas, the beginning of the impact event. And then Giza does the same\nthing, but in much larger scale. It draws our, it uses massive\nmegalithic architecture, which is very difficult to destroy, and a profound knowledge of astronomy to encode a date in a language that any culture which is\nsufficiently literate in astronomy will be able to decode. We don't have to have a\nscript that we can't read, like we do with the\nIndus Valley Civilization or with the Easter Island script. We don't have to have a script\nthat can't be interpreted. If you use astronomical language, then any astronomical\nliterate civilization will be able to give you a date. Hoover Dam has a star map built into it. And that star map is part of an exhibition that was put there at the\nfounding of the Hoover Dam. And what it does is it freezes the sky above the Hoover Dam at the\nmoment of its completion. And Oskar Hansen, the artist\nwho created that piece, said so specifically that this would be so that any future culture\nwould be able to know the time of the dam's construction. So you can use astronomy and architecture to memorialize a particular date. - Quick pause, bathroom break? - [Graham] Sounds good. - So to me, the story that\nwe've been talking about, it is both exciting if the mainstream archeology\nnarrative is correct, and the one you're\nconstructing is correct, both are super interesting because the mainstream\narcheology perspective means that there's something\nabout the human mind from which the pyramids,\nthese ideas spring naturally, you place humans anywhere,\nyou place 'em on Mars, it's gonna come out that way. So that's an interesting\nstory of human psychology that then becomes even more interesting when you evolve out\nAfrica with homo sapiens, how they think about the world. That's super interesting. - [Graham] Yeah. - And then if there's\nan ancient civilization, advanced civilization that explains why there's so many similar\ntypes of ideas that spread, that means that there's\nso much undiscovered. - [Graham] Yeah. - Still.\n- Yeah. - About the sort of the\nspring of these ideas of civilization that come. So to me, they're both fascinating. So I don't know why there's so\nmuch sort of infighting, but. - I think it's partly territorial. I think that, I don't, I can't\nspeak of all archeologists, but some archeologists\nfeel very territorial about their profession, and they do not feel happy about outsiders entering their realm, especially if those outsiders\nhave a large platform. And that's, I found that the\nattacks on me by archeologists have increased step by step with the increase of my exposure. I wasn't very interesting to them when I just had one\nminor bestseller in 1992 with a book called \"The\nSign and the Seal\". But when \"Fingerprints of the\nGods\" was published in 1995 and became a global bestseller, then I started to attract their attention, and appear to have been\nregarded as a threat to them. And that is the case today. That is why \"Ancient Apocalypse\" Season 1 was defined as the most\ndangerous show on Netflix. It's why the Society\nfor American Archeology wrote an open letter to Netflix asking Netflix to reclassify\nthe series as science fiction. It's why they accused the series of antisemitism, misogyny,\nwhite supremacism, and a whole, I don't know, a whole bunch of other things like that. It has nothing to do with\nanything that's in the series. It was like, we must shut this down. This is so dangerous to us. Is it certainly not a danger, there are many more\ndangerous things in the world than a television series\ngoing on right now. But maybe it was seen as\na danger to archeology that this non-archeologist\nwas in archeological terrain and being viewed and seen by large, and read by large numbers of people. Maybe that was part of the problem. And human nature being what it is, I noticed that two of\nmy principal critics, John Hoopes from the University of Kansas, and Flint Dibble, who's now teaching at the\nUniversity of Cardiff in Wales, in the UK, are both people who\nlike to have media exposure. And John Hoopes had just recently\nstarted a YouTube channel. Flint Dibble has had\none for quite a while, pretty small number of followers. I think that they feel that\nthey should be the ones who are getting the global attention, and that it's not right that I am. And that the best way to\nstop that is to stop me, to shut me down, to get me canceled, and basically requiring\nNetflix to relabel my series from a documentary to a science fiction, which is what they\nactually had the temerity to suggest to Netflix. That would, if that had gone through, if Netflix had listened to them, that would've effectively\nbeen the cancellation of my documentary series. It would no longer have been\nranked under documentary. So it was a deliberate\nattempt to shut me down, and I see that going on again and again. And it's so unfortunate\nand so unnecessary. I've become very defensive\ntowards archeology. I hit back. After 30 years of these attacks\non my work, I'm tired of it. And I do defend myself, and sometimes I perhaps\novervigorous in that defense. Maybe I was a little bit too strong in my critique of archeology in the first season of\n\"Ancient Apocalypse\". Maybe I should have been a\nbit gentler and a bit kinder. And I've tried to reflect\nthat in the second season, and to bring also many\nmore indigenous voices into the second season, as well as the voices of\nmany more archeologists. - Yeah, in general, I got\na chance to get a glimpse of the archeology community, and in archeology, in science in general, I don't have much patience\nfor this kind of arrogance or snark or dismissal of\ngeneral human curiosity. - [Graham] Yeah. - That I think your\nwork inspires in people. And so that's why people like Ed Barnhart, who I recently had a\nconversation with, you know, he radiates sort of kindness\nand curiosity as well. And it's like that kind\nof approach to ideas, especially about human\nhistory, it inspires people. - Exactly. - [Lex] Inspires millions\nof people to ask questions. - Exactly. - I mean, that's why you had\nKeanu Reeves on the new season, and he's basically coming to the show from that same perspective of curiosity. - Keanu is genuinely\ncurious about the past, and very, very interested in it. and he's bringing to it questions that everybody brings to the past. He's speaking for every man in the series. - So given that, can you\nmaybe steelman the case that archeologists make about this period that we've been talking about? Can make the case that that\nis indeed what happened, is it was hunter\ngatherers for a long time, and then there was a cataclysm, a very difficult period\nin the human history with the Younger Dryas, and that changed the environment,\nand then led to this, the springing up of civilizations at different places on Earth. Can you sort of make the case for that? - Oh no, I completely understand why that is the position of archeology, because that's what they've found. Archeology is very much wishing to define itself as a science. And it uses the techniques of weighing, and measuring, and counting are very key to what archeology does. And in what they've found and what they've studied around the world, they don't see any traces\nof a lost civilization. And the idea that besides the, we live in a very politically\ncorrect world today. And the idea that some\nkind of lost civilization brought knowledge to other\ncultures around the world is seen as almost racist\nor colonialist in some way. It triggers that aspect as well. But basically, I think\nmajority of archeologists are in complete good faith on this. I don't think that anybody's\nreally seeking to frame me. I think that what we are\nhearing from most archeologists, some much more vicious than others, but what we're hearing\nfrom most archeologists is this is what we found and we don't see evidence for\na lost civilization in it. And to that, I must reply,\nplease look at the myths. Please consider the implications\nof the Younger Dryas. Please look at the ancient astronomy. Please look at those ancient maps, and don't just dismiss\nthem and sneer at them. And for God's sake,\nplease look more deeply at the parts of the world that were immensely\nhabitable and attractive during the Ice Age, and that have hardly been\nstudied by archeology at all before you tell us that your theory is the only one that\ncan possibly be correct. In fact, it's a very arrogant and silly position of archeology, because archeological theories\nare always being overthrown. It can take years, it can take decades. It took decades in the case\nof the Clovis first hypothesis for the settlement of the Americas. But sooner or later, a bad\nidea will be kicked out by a preponderance of evidence that that idea does not explain. - If we can just look back at\nyour debate with Flint Dibble on Joe Rogan Experience, what\nare some takeaways from that? What have you learned, maybe what are some things\nyou like about Flint? You said that he's one\nof your big critics, but what do you like about his ideas and what were you maybe bothered by? - First of all, just very recently, and it can be found on my YouTube channel, and it signaled on my website, I have made a video runs about an hour, which looks at a series of\nstatements that Flint made during the debate, which I\nwas not prepared to answer. And it turns out that\nsome of those statements are not correct. The notion, for example, that there were 3 million\nshipwrecks that have been mapped. Flint actually uses the word \"mapped\", 3 million shipwrecks that have been mapped at one point in the debate. And I've put that clip into\nthe video that I brought out. That is not a fact, that is an estimate, a UNESCO estimate. And actually in the small\nprint on one of the slides that he has on the screen,\nyou can see the word estimate, but he never expresses that word out loud. So those who are listening to the podcast rather than watching it wouldn't even have a chance to see that. And I, sitting there in the studio, didn't see that word estimate either. And I didn't know that. I thought, my God, Flint has a point here. If there've been 3 million\nshipwrecks found and mapped, if that's the case, the absence of any shipwreck\nfrom a lost civilization of the Ice Age is a problem. But then I discover that it\nisn't 3 million shipwrecks that have been mapped. It's much, much less than that. And maybe it's 250,000,\nstill a large number, but most of them from\nthe last thousand years. And unfortunately what\nFlint didn't go into, and perhaps he should have\nshared with the audience, and again, I go into this in the video, is that there is indisputable evidence that human beings were seafarers as much as 50 or 60,000 years ago. The peopling of Australia involved a relatively short 90 kilometers, a hundred kilometer ocean voyage. But nevertheless, it was an ocean voyage. And it must have involved\na large enough people, a large enough number of people to create a permanent population\nthat wouldn't go extinct. The settlement of Cyprus\nis the same thing. It was always an island\neven during the Ice Age. And no ships have survived that speak to the settlement of Australia, and no ships have survived that speak to the settlement\nof Cypress either. But that doesn't mean that\nthat thing didn't happen. - I should just like linger on this, because for me it was the\nshipwrecks thing was convincing. And then looking back, first\nof all, watching your video, but also just realizing the\npeopling of Australia part, that's mind bothering to me. 50,000 years ago. - [Graham] Yeah. - Just imagine being the\nperson standing on the shore, looking out into the ocean, standing on the shore\nof a harsh environment, looking out to the ocean of\neven a harsh environment, and deciding that, you know, what I'm going to go\ntowards near certain death, and explore. - You don't know what's on\nthe other side of that water. You can't see 90 kilometers. - And humans did it.\n- Yeah. - I love it so much. - Again, it's that urge to explore. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I suggest that it probably began with a few pioneers who made\nthe journey there and back. They ventured into the water. They definitely had boats. And lo and behold, after\na two or three day voyage, they ended up on a coastline. You're an individual. You've got by relatively\nstraightforward island hopping with where each island is within sight of each\nother as far as Timor. And when you get to Timor, suddenly you can't island hop anymore. There's an expansive ocean\nthat you can't see across. But that urge to explore, that curiosity that is\ncentral to the human condition would undoubtedly have led\nsome adventurous individuals to want to find out more, and even be willing to risk their lives. And that first reconnoitering\nof what lay beyond that strait would've undoubtedly been undertaken by very few individuals, not enough to create a permanent\npopulation in Australia. But when they came back with the good news that there's a whole land there, that's the land that was in it, that geographers call Sahul, which in just as Sunda was the Ice Age, Indonesian and Malaysian\nPeninsula all joined together into one landmass, so Sahul was New Guinea\njoined to Australia, so they would've made\nlandfall in New Guinea. And then they think, well, here is this vast\nopen, incredible land. We need to bring more people here. And that would've involved larger craft. You need to bring people with resources, and you need to bring enough of them, both men and women, in order\nto produce a population that will not rapidly become extinct. And it's the same in Cyprus. There, the detailed work that's been done suggests very strongly that we are looking at planned migrations of groups of people in excess\nof a thousand at a time, bringing animals with them. And this certainly would've\ninvolved multiple boats, and boats of a significant size. - And there's no archeological\nevidence of those boats. - None whatsoever. The oldest boat that's ever\nbeen found in the world is the Dokos Shipwreck off Greece, which is around 5,000 years\nold, if I recall correctly. - [Lex] So everything that's\nmakes a boat is lost to time. - Yes. Boats can be preserved\nunder certain circumstances. There's a wreck at the\nbottom of the Black Sea, almost two miles deep. I didn't know the Black Sea was that deep. But there's a wreck and\nthere's no oxygen down there, that is more than 2000 years old and is still in pretty\nmuch perfect condition. But in other conditions, the structure of the ship evaporates. Sometimes what you're left\nwith is the cargo of the ship. And you could say there\nwas a ship that sank here, but the ship itself has gone. The fact is, we know that\nour ancestors were seafarers as much as 50,000 years ago, and no ship has survived\nto testify to that, yet we accept that they were. - Do you think one day we'll find a ship that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,000 years old? - It's not impossible. I think it's quite unlikely given the very thin survival of ships, the further back you go in\ntime, with the oldest, as I say, being about 6,000 years old now. And then the other thing\nto take into account is the Younger Dryas event itself and the cataclysmic\ncircumstances of that event, and the roiling of the seas\nthat would've taken place then, how much would've survived in\na boat accident at that time would've survived for\nthousands of years afterwards, I'm not sure, but I don't\ngive up hope it's possible. - So, okay, so that's back\nto the 3 million shipwrecks. - [Graham] Yeah. - So what's your takeaway\nfrom that debate? - Well, my takeaway from that debate is that I should have\nbeen better prepared, and I should have been less angry. I have to say that Flint\nhad really disturbed me with this constant snide, not quite exact references to\nracism and white supremacism in my work. I detest such things. And to have those labels stuck on me, he's always avoided taking\ndirect responsibility, pretty much always avoided. There's one example that I\ninclude in the video I've made where he really hasn't\nsuccessfully avoided it, but in most cases he's trying to say that I rely on sources that were racist, but that he's not saying\nthat I myself am a racist. But the end result of those statements is that people all around the\nworld came to the conclusion that Graham Hancock is a\nracist and a white supremacist. And that really got under my\nskin and it really upset me. And I felt angry about it, and I felt that I was there to defend \"Ancient Apocalypse\" Season 1. Whereas in fact, what I was there to do was to listen to a series of lectures where an archeologist tells me what archeologists have found, and that somehow I'm to deduce that from what they have found, they're not gonna find anything else, at least not anything to do\nwith the lost civilization. - Listen, I feel you, I've seen\nthe intensity of the attacks and the whole racism label is the one that can get under your skin. And it's a toolbox that's been prevalent over\nthe past, let's say decade, maybe a little bit more as\na method of cancellation, when a person has, is\nthe opposite of racist, very often, it's kind\nof hilarious to watch, but it can get under your skin, especially when you have certain dynamics that happen on the internet where it seeps into a Wikipedia page, and then other people\nread that Wikipedia page, and you get to hear it from like friends, oh, I didn't know you're at whatever. And you realize that Wikipedia\ndescription of who you are is actually has a lot of power, not by people that know you well, but by people that just kind\nof are learning about you for the first time. - [Graham] Definitely. - And they can really start to annoy you and get onto your skin when people are kind of\nindirectly injecting, they're writing articles about you that can then be cited by Wikipedia. It can really bother a person who is actually trying to do good science and or just trying to inspire\npeople with different ideas. - I felt that my work was being\ndeliberately misrepresented, and I felt that I, as a\nhuman being, were being, was being insulted and wronged in ways that are deeply hurtful. My wife and I have six\nchildren between us, and we have nine grandchildren, and of those nine grandchildren,\nseven are of mixed race. And this is my family, and these are kids who are gonna\ngrow up and read Wikipedia, and learn from reading Wikipedia that grandpa was some kind of racist. You know, this is a personal issue for me, and I'm afraid I carried that\npersonal anger into the debate and it made me less effective\nthan I should have been. But ultimately I do want\nto pay tribute to Flint. He is an excellent debater. He's got a very sharp mind. He's a very clever man and\nhe's very fast on his feet. And I recognize that I was definitely up against a superior\ndebater in that debate. I'm not sure that I have\nthose debating skills, and I certainly didn't have\nthem on on that particular day. I also admire about Flint something else, which is that he was willing to be there. Most archeologists don't\nwanna talk to me at all. They want to insult me from the sidelines. They want to make sure that Wikipedia keeps on\ncalling me a pseudoarcheologist or a purveyor of\npseudoarcheological theories. They want to make sure that\nthe hints of racism are there, but they actually don't want\nto sit down and confront me. At least Flint was willing to do that, and I'm grateful to him for that. And I think in that sense, it is an important encounter\nbetween people with, let's say an alternative view of history and those with the very much\nmainstream view of history that archeology gives us. And he's also a very determined character. He doesn't give up. So all of those things about\nhim, I admire and respect, but I think he fought\ndirty during the debate. And I've said exactly why in this video that I now have up on YouTube. - To say a positive thing that I enjoyed, I think towards the end, and him speaking about agriculture\nwas pretty interesting. - [Graham] Yeah. - So the techniques of archeology\nare pretty interesting. Like where you can get some insights through the fog of time about\nlike what people were doing, how they were living. That's pretty interesting. - It's very interesting. It's a very important discipline. And I've said many times before, publicly, I couldn't do any of my work without the work that archeologists do. I emphasize very strongly in this video that I don't study what\narcheologists study, but nevertheless, the data that\narcheologists have generated over the last century or so has been incredibly valuable\nto me in the work that I do. But when I look at the great Sphinx and the studies of archeology saying that this is the work\nof the Pharaoh Khafre, despite the absence of any\nsingle contemporary inscription that describes it to Khafre, and in fact the presence\nof other inscriptions that say that it was already\nthere in the time of Khufu, I am not looking at what\nEgyptologists study. They just dismiss all of that and lock into the Khafre connection. At Göbekli Tepe, I'm not really looking at\nwhat archeologists look at. I'm looking at the\nalignments of the megaliths and how they seem to track procession of the star, Sirius,\nover a period of time. Archeologists aren't\ninterested in any of that. So I value and respect archeology. I think it's an incredible tool\nfor investigating our past, but I wish archeologists would bring a slightly gentler frame of mind to it, and a slightly opener perspective. And also that archeologists\nwould be willing to trust the general public\nto make up their own minds. It's as though certain archeologists are afraid of the public being presented with an alternative point of view, which they regard as\nquote unquote dangerous because they somehow\nunderestimate the intelligence of the general public, and think the general public are just going to accept that much. Actually by condemning those\nalternative point of view, archeologists make it much more likely that the general public will accept those alternative point of view, because there is a great\ndistrust of experts in our society today. And behaving in a snobbish, arrogant way, we, archeologists are the only people who are really qualified\nto speak about the past, and anybody else who speaks\nabout the past is dangerous. That actually is not helpful\nto archeology in the long term. There could be a much more positive and a much more cooperative relationship. And I can see that relationship with a gentleman like Ed\nBarnhart was very much the case, with archeologist, Martti Parssinen, from the University of Helsinki, and with geographer, Alceu\nRanzi, Brazilian geographer, very, very senior figure who\nI worked with in the Amazon for Season 2 of \"Ancient Apocalypse\", looking at these astonishing earthworks that have emerged from the Amazon jungle, and which more and more are\nnow being found with LiDAR. Indeed we found some of\nthem ourselves with LiDAR while we were there. - Yeah, that was an\nincredible part of the show that I got a chance to preview, that it's like there's\nall this earthworks, yeah, the traces of\nthings built on the ground that probably you can\nonly really appreciate when you look from up above. - [Graham] That's right. - So the idea that they built stuff that you can only appreciate\nwhen viewed from up above means they had a very\nkind of deep relationship with the sky. - With the sky. - [Lex] Yeah. - And a very good knowledge\nof geometry as well, because these are geometrical structures. And some of them even seem to\nincorporate geometrical games, almost of the kind like\nsquaring the circle. It's not quite that, but you\nhave a lovely square earthwork with a lovely circle earthwork\nright in the middle of it. Whatever else they were,\nthey were geometers. They were not just builders of\nfantastically huge earthworks that nobody expected in the Amazon, not just builders of cities that we now know existed in the Amazon, but that they were astronomers\nand mathematicians as well. - Everything we're talking\nabout is so full of mystery. It's just fascinating, especially\nthe farther back we go. - That's what I love about the past is the mystery that's there. And that's another thing that I regret about some archeologists is that their mission seems to be to drain all mystery out of the past, to suck it dry, like some kind of vampire sucking the blood out of the past, and to reduce it to a series of numbers that appear to be scientific. I think that's most unfortunate. The past is deeply mysterious. The whole story of life on\nEarth is deeply mysterious. I mean, we were talking about\nthe timeline of human beings, but you know, if you go\nback to the formation of the Earth itself, if I've got the figures right, it's about four and a\nhalf billion years ago that the Earth supposedly formed. It was then incredibly hot\nand inhospitable to life for the next several\nhundred million years. But it was actually Francis Crick who pointed out something odd, that within a hundred million years of the Earth being cool\nenough to support life, there's bacterial life\nall over the planet. And Crick wrote a book\ncalled \"Life Itself\", that was published in 1981, and he suggested that\nlife had been brought here by a process of panspermia. Now that's an idea that's\naround in circulation, that comets may carry bacteria, which concede life on planets. But Crick actually in \"Life Itself\" was talking about directed panspermia. He envisaged, this is Crick, not me, he envisaged an alien civilization far away across the galaxy,\nwhich faced extinction. Perhaps a supernova was gonna\ngo off in the neighborhood. They were highly advanced. Their first thought might have been, let's get ourselves off the planet, and go and populate some other planet. But the distances of\ninterstellar space were so great. So their second thought\nwas, let's preserve our DNA, let's put bacteria, genetically engineered bacteria\ninto cryogenic chambers and fire them off into the\nuniverse in all directions. And bottom line of Crick's\ntheory in \"Life Itself\" is one of those cryogenic containers containing bacterial life\nfrom another solar system crashed into the early Earth, and that's why life began\nso suddenly here on Earth. - If we as a human civilization continue, I think that is a one way\nto create backups of us elsewhere in the universe, given the space is to do a life\ngun and shoot it everywhere. - [Graham] Yeah. - And it just plants. - [Graham] Yes, yes. - And you kind of hope\nthat whatever is the magic that makes up human consciousness. And if that magic is already\nthere in the initial DNA of the bacteria. - The potential for that magic is there. - The potential is there. - And evolutionary forces will work upon it and in different ways, in different environments, but that the potential is there, yes. It's something that we would do. If we were facing a complete extinction\nof life on planet Earth, a major global effort would be\nmade to preserve it somehow. And that might well include firing off cryogenic chambers into the universe and hoping that some of them would land somewhere hospitable. - And as you were mentioning, there's just so many interesting mysteries along the way here, for example, I mean, it's like, I think like 3 billion years\nit was single cell organisms. - [Graham] Yeah. - So it seems like life is pretty good, single cell organisms, that there's no need for multicellularity, that like for animals, for\nany of this kind of stuff. So why is that? It seems like you could adapt much better if you are a more complicated organism. It took a really long\ntime to take that leap. Is it because it's really hard to do? And what was the forcing\nfunction to do that kind of leap? And the same, I mean, for us to be\nselfish and self-obsessed, for us humans, like what was the magic\nleap to homo sapiens from the other hominids, and why did homo sapiens\nwin out against Neanderthals and the other competitors? Why are they not around anymore? So those are all fascinating mysteries, and it feels like the more we\npropose sort of radical ideas about our past, take\nit serious and explore, the more we'll be able to\nsort of figure out that puzzle that leads all the way\nback to homo sapiens, and maybe all the way back to\nthe origin of life on Earth. - Yeah, yeah. I think that homo sapiens is the tail end of a very long, deep series of mysteries that goes back right to the\nbeginning of life on this planet and probably long before actually, 'cause this planet is\npart of the universe, and God knows what else is\nout there in the universe. - Why do you think homo sapiens evolved? Why, like what was the magic thing? So there's a bunch of theories about fire, leading to meat, to cooking,\nwhich can fuel the brain, that's one. The other is like social interaction. We're able to use our\nimagination to construct ideas and share those ideas\nand tell great stories, and that is somehow an\nevolutionary advantage. Do you have any like\nfavorite conception of? - Well, it's interesting. There's no doubt that\nanatomically modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in Europe for at least 10,000 years,\nprobably more than that. And yet one of the popular views is that anatomically modern humans wiped out the Neanderthals,\nthat we killed them off. But at the same time\nwe were inter-breeding with the Neanderthals. In a sense, the Neanderthals are not gone. They're still within us today. We are part Neanderthal. There's another theory\nthat I've read about, well, there is some evidence that Neanderthals were cannibals, that there was ritual cannibalism took place amongst Neanderthals, and particularly the\neating of human brains. And this can cause Kuru, which can kill off whole populations. That's what another suggestion of why the Neanderthals died out. There's lots of possibilities\nthat have been put forward. Maybe we just outcompeted them, you know? Maybe anatomically modern humans\nhad some brain connections that they didn't have, even\nthough the Neanderthal brain was bigger than the brain of anatomically modern human beings. As the old saying goes,\nsize isn't everything. Maybe we just had a more\ncompact, more efficient brain. The fact of the matter is that\nNeanderthals and Denisovans did not survive the rise of homo sapiens. - For our discussion though, what is interesting is all the hominids seem to be explorers. - [Graham] Yes. - They spread. I mean, I didn't know this. - The fact that homo erectus\nwas all over the planet more than a million years\nago is testament to that. And I do think that exploration urge is fundamental to humanity. And I would like to say\nthat's what I think I'm doing. I'm exercising my urge to\nexplore the past in my own way, making my own path and\ndefining my own route. - That's the leap from non-human to human. One of the things you've discussed is your idea of what was the\nleap to human civilization. What is the driver, what is\nthe inspiration for humans to form civilizations? And for you, that's shamanism. - [Graham] Definitely. - Can you explain what that means? - I think that shamanism\nis the origin of everything of value in humanity. I think it was the\nearliest form of science. When I spend time with\nshamans in the Amazon, I observe people who are constantly\nexperimenting with plants in a very scientific way. They're always trying a pinch\nof this and a pinch of that in different forms, for\nexample, of the ayahuasca brew, to see if it enhances it or\nmakes it different in any way. The invention of curare is a\nremarkable scientific feat, which is entirely down\nto shamans in the Amazon. They are the scientists\nof the hunter forger state of society. And they were the ancient\nleaders of human civilization. So I think all civilization\narises out of shamanism. And shamanism is a naturally\nscientific endeavor where experimentation is undertaken, an exploration and investigation of the environment around us. And what I'm suggesting is that one group, perhaps more than one group, went a bit further than other groups did, and used that study of the skies and developed navigational techniques and were able to sail\nand explore the Earth. But that ultimately what lies behind it is the same curiosity\nand investigative skill that shamans are still using\nin the Amazon to this day. And I do see them as scientists in a very proper use of the word. - But do you think\nsomething like ayahuasca was a part of that process? - Yes, ayahuasca is the result\nof shamanistic investigation of what's available in the Amazon. Of course, ayahuasca is all the fad in Western industrialized societies today. And some people see it as a miracle cure for all kind of ailments and problems. And perhaps it is, perhaps\nit can be in certain ways. Ayahuasca itself is not an Amazonian word. It comes from the Quechua language, and it means the vine of\nsouls, or the vine of the dead. But the ayahuasca vine is only one of two principal ingredients in the ayahuasca brew. And the other ingredients are leaves that contain\ndimethyl tryptamine. And there are two sources of that. One is a bush called Psychotria viridis, that's its botanical name. They call it Chacruna in the Amazon. And its leaves are rich in\ndimethyl tryptamine, DMT, which is arguably the\nmost powerful psychedelic known to science. And the other source\ncomes from another vine, Diplopterys cabrerana, which the leaves of that\nvine also contained DMT. So the ayahuasca vine on its own is not going to give\nyou a visionary journey. And the leaves that\ncontain DMT on their own, whether they come from Diplopterys or whether they come from chacruna, are not gonna give you\na visionary journey. And the reason they're not gonna give you the visionary journey is\nbecause of the enzyme, monoamine oxidase in the gut, that shuts down DMT when absorbed orally. Basically, DMT is not accessible orally, unless you combine it with a\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor. And that's what I mean when\nI'm talking about science in the Amazon, 'cause there's\nso many tens of thousands, hundreds thousands different species of plants and trees in the Amazon. And they've gone around, and they found just two or\nthree of them that put together, can produce these extraordinary\nvisionary experiences. - Just imagine the number of\nplants they had to have eaten. - Yeah. - Consumed and smoked or\nall kinds of combinations to arrive at that. - Exactly, exactly. To realize that this is\nsomething very special. And then to use the principles there to find another form of it. So ayahuasca is the form that is made with the ayahuasca vine and the leaves of the chacruna plant. But yahe is made from the ayahuasca vine and the leaves of another\nvine, Diplopterys cabrerana, which contain not only N,N-DMT, which is the DMT that\neverybody's pretty much familiar with these days, but also 5-MeO-DMT. And the yahe experience,\nwhich I have also had, in my view, is more\nintense and more powerful, almost to the point of being overwhelming than the ayahuasca experience. But what the result of this\nsophisticated chemistry that we find taking place here is a brew, which is hideous to drink. The taste, I find it quite repulsive. I almost retched just\nsmelling it in the cup, but then unleashes these\nextraordinary experiences. And it isn't just pretty visuals, it's the sense of encounters\nwith sentient others, that there are sentient beings that somehow we are surrounded\nby a realm of sentients that is not normally accessible to us. And that what the ayahuasca brew, and certain other psychedelics, like some psilocybin mushrooms\nin a high enough dose can do it as well. LSD can do it. But ayahuasca is the master in this of lowering the veil to what appears to be a seamlessly convincing\nother realm, other world. And of course the hard\nline rational scientists will say that's just all\nfantasies of your brain. But I don't think we fully understand or even close to understanding exactly what consciousness is. And I remain open to two possibilities, that consciousness is\ngenerated by the brain, is made by the brain in the\nway that a factory makes cars. But I also am open to the possibility that the brain is a\nreceiver of consciousness, just as a television set is the receiver of television signals. And that if that is the case, then we locked into the physical realm, we need our everyday alert problem solving\nstate of consciousness. And that's the state of consciousness that western civilization\nvalues and highly encourages. But these other states of consciousness that allow us to access\nalternative realities are possibly more important. It may be apocryphal, but it was reported after Francis Crick's\nrole and his Nobel Prize for the discovery of the double helix, that he finally got it\nunder the influence of LSD. There's the classic example of Kary Mullis and the polymerase chain reaction. He said he got that under\nthe influence of LSD. So the notion that the\nalert problem solving state of consciousness is the only valuable\nstate of consciousness is disproved by valuable experiences that people have had in a visionary state. But the question that remains unresolved is those entities that\nwe encounter in the, and not everybody encounters them, and you're certainly not\ngoing to encounter them on every ayahuasca trip. There are ayahuasca journeys\nwhere nothing seems to happen. I suspect something does happen, but it happens at a subconscious level. I know that shamans in the\nAmazon regard those trips where actually you don't see visions as amongst the most valuable. And they say you are learning stuff that you're not remembering,\nbut you're learning it anyway. These sentient others that are\nencountered, what are they? You know, are they just\nfigments of our brain on drugs, or are we actually gaining\naccess to a parallel reality where, which is inhabited\nby consciousness, which is in a non-physical form? And I'm equally open to that idea. I think that may be what is\ngoing on here with ayahuasca. But the other thing is\nthat there is a presence within the ayahuasca brew, and she is both present, both\nin ayahuasca and in yahe. And that's one of the\nreasons why the shamans say that actually the master of the process is the ayahuasca vine, not the leaves. It's as though the vine\nhas harnessed the leaves to gain access to human consciousness. And there, if you have sufficient exposure to ayahuasca or yahe, you\ndrink it enough times, I've had maybe 75 or 80\njourneys with ayahuasca. You definitely start to\nfeel an intelligent presence with a definite personality,\nwhich I interpret as feminine, and which most people in the\nwest interpret it as feminine, and they call her Mother Ayahuasca. There are some tribes in the Amazon who interpret the spirit\nof ayahuasca as male, but in all cases, that\nspirit is seen as a teacher. That's fundamentally what ayahuasca is. It's a teacher and it\nteaches moral lessons. And that's fascinating that\na mixture of two plants should cause us to reflect\non our own behavior and how it may have hurt and\ndamaged and affected others, and fill us with a\npowerful wish not to repeat that negative behavior\nagain in the future. The more baggage you carry in your life, the heart of the beating that\nayahuasca is going to give you until it forces you to confront\nand take responsibility for your own behavior. And that is an extraordinary thing to come from a plant brew in that way. And I think in, yes, I think\nayahuasca is the most powerful of all the plant medicines for accessing these mysterious realms. But there's no doubt you can access them. They're all tryptamines, they're all related to\none another in one way. You can access 'em through LSD, and you certainly can access them through psilocybe mushrooms\nas well in large enough dose. - Both possibilities, as you\ndescribe, are interesting. And to me, they're kind\nof akin to each other, is I wonder what the limit\nof the brain's capacity is to create imaginary worlds\nand treat them seriously and make them real. And in those worlds, explore, and have real sort of moral\ndeep brainstorming sessions with those entities. So it's almost like the power\nof the human mind to imagine, taken to its limit. - It is. And the curious thing is\nthat the same iconography, people paint their visions\nafter ayahuasca sessions. People were painting in Europe in the cave of Lascaux, for example. And of course they had\naccess to psilocybe mushrooms in prehistoric Europe. There's a remarkable\ncommonality in the imagery that is painted. I like to give credit where credit is due. And there are two names that\nneed to be mentioned here. One is the late great Terence McKenna and his book, \"Food of the Gods\", where he proposed the idea very strongly that it was our ancestral\nencounters with psychedelics that made us fully human. That's what switched on\nthe modern human mind. And very much the same idea began to be explored a bit earlier by Professor David Lewis-Williams at the University of\nWitwatersrand in South Africa, fabulous book called\n\"The Mind in the Cave\", where he's again arguing that\nthese astonishing similarities in cave art and rock\nart all around the world can only be properly explained by people in deeply altered\nstates of consciousness, attempting to remember when they return to a normal everyday state of consciousness, attempting to remember their visions and document them on permanent media like the wall of a cave. So typically you get a\nlot of geometric patterns, but you also got entities. And those entities often\nare the therianthropes, part animal part human in form. Might have the head of a wolf\nand the body of a human being, might have the head of a bird\nand the body of a human being, and so on and so forth, and that they communicate with\nus in the visionary state. Interestingly, although\nthis sounds like woo woo, and it is an area that most scientists would steer clear of at\nrisk of their careers. There is very serious work now being done at Imperial College in London and at the University of\nCalifornia at San Diego where volunteers are\nbeing given extended DMT. There's a new technology, DMTx, where the DMT is fed directly\ninto the bloodstream by drip. And it's possible to keep the individual in the peak DMT state, which normally when you smoke or vape DMT, you're looking, if you're\nlucky, at 10 minutes, or if you're unlucky,\nif it's a bad journey, because those 10 minutes\ncan seem like forever. But with DMTx, with\nthe drip feeding of DMT into the bloodstream, these volunteers actually could be kept in the peak state for hours. And unlike LSD where you\nrapidly build up tolerance, nobody ever builds up tolerance to DMT. It always hits you with the same power, even if you took it\nyesterday and the day before, and you're taking it tomorrow as well, it's still gonna have that same power. There's no tolerance there. So that's how they can\nuse that lack of tolerance to keep volunteers in this state. And then when they\ndebrief those volunteers, they're also putting them in MRI scanners and looking at what's\nhappening in the brain. But when they debrief them, they're all talking about\nencounters with sentient others. There's even a group now\ncalled Sentient Others, where people are exchanging, volunteers are now\nexchanging their experiences. They didn't do so, they\nweren't allowed to do so at the beginning of the experiment, but now that most of them have left it, they're exchanging their experiences, and it's all about encounters\nwithin sentient others who wish to teach them moral lessons. Now, to me, that's wild. What is going on here? What, how do we account for this? Yeah, I get the notion of hallucinations and brightly colored visuals, but the moral lessons that come with it, those are very hard. - Yeah, and would you say that the reason that could give birth to a civilization, is it because such visions\ncan help create myths, and especially like religious myths, that would be a cohesive thing for a large group of people to get around. - Yeah, and can help\nus to be better members of our own community, - Right, with moral lessons. - Yeah, more contributing\nmembers of our community, more caring, more nurturing\nmembers of our community. That's got to be good for any community. I've said this a dozen\ntimes, but I'll say it again. If I had the power to do so, I would make it a law, an\nabsolute law that anybody running for a powerful political position, particularly if that position\nis president or head of state in any kind of way, that\nthat person has to undergo the ayahuasca ordeal first. They have to have 10 or\n12 sessions of ayahuasca as a condition for applying for the job. I suspect that most who\nhad had those experiences wouldn't want to apply\nfor the job anymore. They would want to live\na different kind of life. And those who did want to carry on being a leader of a nation would be very different people from the people who are leading\nthe nations of the Earth into chaos and destruction today. - Yeah, they'll be doing\nit for the right reasons. I mentioned to you, I recently\ninterviewed Donald Trump, and I actually brought up this same idea that it would be a much better\nworld if most of Congress and most of politicians would take some form of psychedelic,\nat the very least. - Yeah, I have no doubt that\nit would be a bad world. I mean, this raises an interesting point, which is the role of government in controlling our consciousness. And in my opinion, the\nso-called war on drugs is one of the fundamental\nabuses of human rights that have been undertaken\nin the past 60 years. It should be a Republican issue. If I understand the\nRepublican Party correctly, the Republican Party believes in individual freedom for\nadults as much as possible, and particularly the freedom to make choices over their own bodies. But in the case of even cannabis, I know there's one of the great things that's happening in America. It's happening state by state where cannabis is being legalized on that draconian hand of government has being taken off the back of people who are consuming a medicine that is far less harmful than alcohol, which is glorified in our society. We cannot say that we are free\nif we allow our government to dictate to us what experiences we may or may not have in\nour inner consciousness while doing no harm to others. And the point there is we\nalready have a whole raft of laws that deal with us when\nwe do harm to others. Do we really need laws that tell us what we may or may not experience in the inner sanctum of\nour own consciousness? I think it's a fundamental\nviolation of adult sovereignty. And we would have much less drug problems if these drugs were all legalized and made available to\npeople without shaming them, without punishing them in any way, but just part of normal social life. And then you could be sure that you were getting good product rather than really shitty product, which has been cut with\nall sorts of other things. Ultimately, the way forward is for adults to take responsibility\nfor their own behavior, and for society to allow that to happen and not to have big government\ntaking responsibility for decisions that should be\nin the hands of individuals. - And for me also, it's exciting, some of these substances like psilocybin are being integrated to scientific\nstudies at large scales. It's really interesting. - We've seen a revolution in the way science looks at psychedelics in the last 20, 25 years. They were in that highly\ndemonized category. But again, it's one of those paradigms which gets overwhelmed by new evidence. And it began to be\nrealized that psilocybin and other psychedelics are very helpful in a range of conditions from which people suffer\npost-traumatic stress disorder, the fear of death when you are suffering\nfrom terminal cancer can be overwhelming. And it's been found that\npsilocybin can remove that. Deep depressions can be evaporated with one single massive\npsilocybin journey. They just go away. There's really good science on this, and they are being integrated into conventional medicine more and more. We'll see it happening, I'm not sure if it'll happen as fast as I would like to see\nit happen in my lifetime, but it is gonna happen. - Yeah, actually just recently found out that you had a TED Talk,\nwar on consciousness. - [Graham] Yes. - That was taken down. - [Graham] Yeah. - And that was just part of\njust the general resistance, because it was a pretty, it wasn't radical, wasn't really erratic. - I was talking about ayahuasca, and I was talking about the\nview that I hold very strongly, that as long as we do no harm to others, sovereign adults should be\nallowed to make decisions about their own bodies, and not face a jail sentence\nor shaming as the result. But this, so it was a\nTEDx Talk, not a TED Talk, organized by a local TED group. They call them TEDx Talks. And I gave this talk about\nthe war on consciousness, and it was immediately pulled\ndown from TED's main channel with all kinds of bizarre\nreasons being given. But unfortunately it was too late because a number of people had\nalready downloaded the talk and then uploaded it onto\nother YouTube channels. And actually their banning\nof it made it go viral in a way that would not\nhave happened otherwise. But again, it's a sign that points of view that are not acceptable to\nthose in positions of power are simply dismissed and shut down, or at least attempts are made to do so. - In general, just along\nthat line of thinking, I'm pretty sure that what we understand about consciousness today\nwill seem silly to humans from a hundred years from now. - You bet it will, especially\nif we harness psychedelics to investigate consciousness. And you know, that is what is happening at Imperial College right now is the investigation of the experience. They're not looking,\nthere are other trials that are looking for the\ntherapeutic potential of DMT, but in this case, they're looking entirely at the experiences that people have and why they're so similar from people from different age\ngroups and different genders and different parts of the world are all having the same experiences. - And for me, from an\nengineering perspective, it's interesting if it's possible to engineer consciousness\nin artificial beings. - [Graham] Yeah. - it's another way to\napproach the question of how special is human consciousness? - [Graham] Yeah. - How, from where does it arise? Is it something that\npermeates all of life? And then in that case, what is the thing that makes life special? Like what is life? What is these living\norganisms that we have here and that evolve to create humans, and what is truly special about humans and is both scary and exciting\nto consider the possibility that we can create something like this. - [Graham] Yeah, but why not? We are a vehicle for\nconsciousness, in my view. I think consciousness is\npresent in all life on earth. I don't think it's\nlimited to human beings. We have the equipment to manifest and express that consciousness in the way that a dog,\nfor example, doesn't have, or a snail doesn't have,\nor a pigeon doesn't have. But when I look at two pigeons\nsitting on my garden fence and rubbing up close to each other, and enjoying each other's company, and taking off together\nand hanging out together, I think they're conscious beings. And I think consciousness is everywhere. I think it's the basis of everything. And I suspect that fundamentally, consciousness is non-physical, and that it can manifest in physical forms where it can then have experiences that would not be available\nin the non-physical state. That's a guess. - That'd be a fascinating, because then you can construct\nall kinds of physical forms to manifest the consciousness. - And see if consciousness\nenters, if they become conscious. Isn't there some suggestion that artificial intelligence\nis already becoming conscious? - That makes humans really uncomfortable. - [Graham] Yeah. - Because we are at the\ntop of the food chain, we consider ourselves truly special. And to consider that there's other things that could be special is scary. - Well, look how other people\nmake us uncomfortable too. I mean, look at the\nstate of the world today, all the conflicts that are raging. That's because we're afraid. When I say we, I'm\nspeaking nation by nation, that we are afraid of other people. We fear that they're going to hurt us or damage us in some way, and so we seek to stop that. It's the root of many,\nmany conflicts, this fear. And so fear of AI may not be\nsuch a good idea after all. It might be very interesting\nto go down that route and see where it comes. Certainly in terms of\nexploring consciousness, it is very interesting. - Yeah, fear is a useful thing, but it can also be destructive. - Well, it could be destructive and it can shut you down completely. - If you look into the future, maybe in the next a hundred years, what do you hope are the interesting\ndiscoveries in archeology that we'll find? - Well, I'd really like to know how the Great Pyramid was built. And we now have with new tech,\nwith scanning technology, it's now become apparent that there are many major\nvoids within the Great Pyramid. Right above the Grand Gallery, there's a, what looks like\na second Grand Gallery that has been identified\nwith remote scanning and new chambers. One of them has even been opened up, already being found as a result of this. So it may be that the seat that the Great Pyramid will\nultimately give up its secrets. I often think that the Great Pyramid is partly designed to do that. It's designed to invite its own initiates. Some people aren't interested\nin the Great Pyramid at all, but some people are fascinated by it and they're drawn towards it. And when they're drawn towards it, it immediately starts raising\nquestions in their minds and they seek answers to their questions. So it's like saying, here\nI stand, investigate me, find out about me, figure out what I am. Why have I got these two shafts cut into the side of the\nso-called Queen's Chamber? Why do they slope up through\nthe body of the Great Pyramid? Why do they not exit on the\noutside of the Great Pyramid? Why when we send a robot up those shafts, do we find them after about 160 feet blocked by a door with metal handles? Why when we drill through that\ndoor to see what's beyond it, three or four feet away,\nwe see another door. It's like very frustrating, but it's saying to us, keep on exploring. If you're persistent enough, we'll eventually give you the answer. So I'm hoping that that answer will come as to how this most\nmysterious of monuments was actually built and the\ninspiration that lay behind it. Certainly, I'm sure it was\nnever a tomb or a tomb only. The later pyramids might have been, actually no pharaonic burial has been discovered in any pyramid. But nevertheless, it's pretty\nclear that the later pyramids with the pyramid text\nwritten on the walls, like the Pyramid of Unas, fifth dynasty, Pyramid at Saqqara, were tombs. But the Great Pyramid, to go to that length to create a tomb, to make it a scale model of the Earth, to orient it perfectly to true north, to make it 6 million tons. This is not a tomb,\nthis is something else. This is a curiosity device. This is something that is\nasking us to understand it. And I hope we will understand it. And I hope Egyptologists will be willing to set\naside that prejudice, that they're only looking at a tomb and consider other possibilities. And as new tech is revealing these previously unknown inner spaces within the Great Pyramid, I think that's gonna become\nmore and more likely. - So not just the how it\nwas built, but the why. - [Graham] But the why. - And to you, it seems obvious that there would be a cosmic motivation. - Yeah, very, very much so. As above, so below. You know, which is an\nidea in the Hermetica, the God, Hermes, for the Greeks, was the Greek version of Thoth, the wisdom God of Ancient Egypt. And that's where that saying comes from. It comes from the Hermetica, but it's expressing an\nAncient Egyptian idea to mirror the perfection\nof the heavens on Earth. - So you think there's\nsomething interesting to be discovered about how it was built? You mean beyond the sort of the ideas of the using ramps and wet sand? - Yeah, ramps won't do it. Ramps won't do it, nor will wet sand. It's true that the Ancient\nEgyptians did haul big objects on sleds on wet sand. There are even reliefs\nthat show the process where an individual is standing on the front of the\nsled pouring water down to lubricate the sand underneath. And that's a perfectly respectable way to move a 200 ton block of\nstone across sand, flat sand, if you have enough people to pull it. But that is not gonna help you get dozens of 70 ton granite blocks,\n300 feet in the air to form the roof of the King's Chamber and the floor of the chamber above it, and the roof of that chamber, and the floor of the chamber above that and so on and so forth. Wet sand never got those objects up there. Somehow they were lifted up there. Now, yeah, ramps are\nproposed as the solution, but where are the remains of those ramps? If you're going to carry blocks weighing up to two or three tons right to the top of the Great Pyramid to complete your work, you're gonna need a ramp\nthat's going to extend out into the desert for more than a mile at a 10 degree slope. And it's calculated that a 10 degree slope is about the maximum slope that human labor can\nhaul objects up a ramp, and that ramp can't just be compacted sand since heavy objects are being hauled up. It's gonna have to be made\nof very solid material, almost as solid as the pyramid itself. Where is it? We don't see any trace\nof those so-called ramps that are supposed to have been involved in the construction of the pyramid. I think we don't know. I think we have no idea it's built, that's why there's so\nmany different theories. We haven't got the answer yet, but the how of it is one of the\nbig mysteries from our past. - I love the Great Pyramids\nas a kind of puzzle that was created by the\nancient peoples to be solved. - [Graham] Yeah. - By later peoples. I mean, this is, I don't\nknow if you're aware of the 10,000 year clock that-- - [Graham] I'm not, no. - That was built by Jeff\nBezos and Danny Hillis in Sierra Diablo mountains in Texas. So they're building a clock\nthat ticks once a year for 10,000 years. - [Graham] Oh, wow. - So it's talking about, and\nit's supposed to sort of run, you know, if there's a nuclear apocalypse, it just runs. And it's an example of\nmodern humans thinking like, okay, if 10,000 years from now and beyond, if something goes wrong, or the future humans that\nare way different, come back, and they analyze what happened here, how can we create monuments\nthat they could then analyze? - [Graham] Yeah. - And in that way, be curious\nabout, in their curiosity, discover some deep truths\nabout this current time. It's an interesting\nkind of notion of like, what can we build now? - That would last. And the answer is that the\nmajority of what we build now wouldn't last. - It wouldn't. - It would be gone within\na few thousand years. But what would last is\nmassive megalithic structures, like the Great Pyramid, that would last. And it could be used to send\na message to the future. I think Göbekli Tepe\nserves a similar function. I mean, there it was,\nburied 10,400 years ago, and then for the next 10,000\nyears, nobody touched it. Nobody knew it was there. It took the genius of Klaus\nSchmidt, the original excavator, to realize what he'd found and what it. But the great thing about\nthe ceiling of Göbekli Tepe, the deliberate burial of Göbekli Tepe, is it means that no later\nculture trod over it and imposed their organic materials on it, and messed up the dating\nsequences and so on and so forth, or vandalized it or used it as a quarry. It's all there intact. - So you mentioned that the pyramids and some of the other amazing\nthings that humans have built was the result of us humans\nstruggling with our mortality. - That's the ultimate goal. That seems to me what's at the heart of many pyramids around the world is that they're connected\nin one way or another to the notion of death and to the notion of the\nexploration of the afterlife. And this is of course,\nthe fundamental mystery that all human beings face. We may wish to ignore it,\nwe may wish to pretend that it's not gonna happen, but we are of course, all\nmortal, every one of us, all 8 billion or however many of us that\nare on the planet right now, we're all gonna face\ndeath sooner or later. And the question is what happens? And there are a few cultures\nthat really intensely, deeply studied that mystery. We are not one of them. The general view of science, I think, is that we're accidents of evolution. When we die, the light blinks out. There's no more of us. There's no such thing as the soul. But that's not a proven point. There's no experiment that\nproves that's the case. We know we die, but we don't know whether there's such a\nthing as a soul or not. - Yeah, it's the great mystery. - It's a great mystery that we all share, and those cultures that\nhave investigated it, and Ancient Egypt is the best example, have investigated it thoroughly and map out the journey\nthat we make after death. But that notion of a journey after death and have hazards and\nchallenges along the way, and ultimately of a judgment, that notion is found\nright around the world, and it even manifests into the three monotheistic face that are still present in the world today. - Well, you're one such human, and you said you\ncontemplate your own death. - [Graham] Yeah. - Are you afraid of it? - No, I'm not afraid of death at all. I'm curious about death. I think it could be very interesting. I think it's the beginning\nof the next great adventure. So I don't fear it. And I would like to live as long as my body is healthy enough to make living worthwhile. But I don't fear death. What I do fear is pain. I do fear the humiliation that old age and the collapse of the\nfaculties can bring. I do fear the cancers\nthat can strike us down and riddle us with pain and agony. That I fear very, very much indeed. But death is gonna come to all of us. I accept it it's gonna come to me. And I'm not gonna say I'm\nlooking forward to it, but when it happens, I'm\ngonna approach it I hope, with a sense of curiosity\nand a sense of adventure. That there's something beyond this life. It isn't heaven, it isn't\nhell, but there's something. The soul goes on. I think reincarnation is\na very plausible idea. Again, modern science would reject that. But there's the excellent\nwork of Ian Stevenson, children who remember past lives, who found that children\nup to the age of seven often have memories of past lives. And in cultures where\nmemories of past lives are discouraged, they tend\nnot to express that much. But in cultures where memories\nof past lives are encouraged, like India, they do express it. And he found several subjects, children under the age of seven in India who were able to remember\nspecific details of a past life. And he was able to go to the place where that past life unfolded\nand validate those details. So if consciousness is\nthe basis of everything, if it's the essence of everything, and consciousness benefits in some way from being incarnated in physical form, then reincarnation makes a lot of sense. All the investment that the universe has put into creating this home for life may have a much bigger\npurpose than just accident. - What a beautiful mystery\nthis whole thing is. - Yeah, we are immersed in mystery. We live in the midst of mystery. We're surrounded by mystery. And if we pretend otherwise,\nwe're deluding ourselves. - And Graham, thank you so much for inspiring the world\nto explore that mystery. Thank you for talking today. - Thank you, Lex. It's been a pleasure. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Graham Hancock.
