  "full_text": "- So people need to go back and read the history of the\nfirst 100 days under FDR, the sheer amount of\nlegislation that went through, his ability to bring Congress to heel and the Senate. He gets all this stuff through. But as you and I know, legislation takes a long time\nto put into place, right? We've had people starving on the streets all throughout 1933 under Hoover. The difference was, Hoover was\nseen as this do nothing joke, who would dine nine course\nmeals in the White House and he is a filthy rich banker, FDR comes in there and every single day\nhas seen fireside chats, he's passing legislation. But more importantly, so he tries various different programs. Then they get ruled\nunconstitutional, he tries even more. So what does America take away from that? Every single time, if he gets knocked down,\nhe comes back fighting. And that was a really\npart of his character that he developed after he got polio. And it was, it gave him the\nstrength to persevere through personally what he could\ntransfer in his calm demeanor and his feeling of fight\nthat America really got that spirit from him and was able to climb itself\nout of the Great Depression. He's such an inspirational figure. I think of Johnson and of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can give you a laundry list of personal problems that\nall those people had. I think they had a really,\nreally good judgment and I'm not sure how intrinsic their own\npersonal character was to their exploration and\nthinking about the world. So JFK is actually, JFK\nmight be our best example because he had the best judgment\nout of anybody in a room as a brand new president in\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis. And he got us out and avoided nuclear war, which he deserves eternal credit for that. And I encourage people out\nthere, this is a brutal text. We were forced to read\nit in graduate school. The \"Essence of Decision\"\nby Graham Allison. I'm so thankful we did. It's one of the foundations\nof political science because it lays out theories\nof how government works. People really need to\nunderstand Washington. Washington is a creature with traditions, with institutions that\ndon't care about you. They don't even really\ncare about the president. They have self-perpetuating mechanisms which have been done a certain way. And it usually takes\na great shocking event like World War II to\nchange really anything beyond the marginal. Every once in a while, you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt who's actually able to\ntake peacetime presidency and transform the country, but it needs an extraordinary individual to get something like that done. So the question around the\n\"Essence of Decision\" was the theory behind the Cuban Missile Crisis of how Kennedy arrived at his decision. And there are various\ndifferent schools of thought, but one of the things I love\nabout the book is it presents a case for all three, the\norganizational theory, the bureaucratic politics theory, and then kind of the\ngreat man theory as well. So there's a, you know,\nyou and I could sit here and I could tell you a case about PT-109 and about how John F. Kennedy\nexperienced World War II and how he literally swam miles with a wounded man's life\njacket strap in his teeth with a broken back and he saved him and he ended up on the\ncover of Life Magazine and he was a war hero and he\nwas a deeply smart individual who wrote a book in 1939\ncalled \"Why England Slept,\" which to this day is considered a text, which at the moment was\nable to describe in detail why Neville Chamberlain and the British political system arrived at the policy of appeasement. I actually have a original copy. It's one of my most prized possessions. Because, and from 1939, because this is a 23-year-old kid, who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy? Turns out he's a brilliant man. And another just favorite aside is that at the Potsdam Conference, you know, where Harry Truman is there\nwith Stalin and everybody. So in the room at the same time, Harry S. Truman, president\nof the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general, right, who will succeed him, 26-year-old John F.\nKennedy as a journalist. And all three of those\npresidents were in the same room with Joseph Stalin and others. And that's the story\nof America right there. It's kind of amazing. I'm gonna give you one of\nthe most depressing quotes, which is deeply true. Roger Ailes, who is a genius, shout out to \"The Loudest\nVoice in the Room\" by Gabriel Sherman, that\nbook changed my life too, because it really made\nme understand media. People don't wanna be informed,\nthey wanna feel informed. - The following is a\nconversation with Saagar Enjeti, his second time in the podcast. Saagar is a political\ncommentator, journalist, co-host of \"Breaking\nPoints\" with Krystal Ball and of \"The Realignment\"\npodcast with Marshall Kosloff. Saagar is one of the most\nwell-read people I've ever met. His love of history and the wisdom gained from reading thousands of\nhistory books radiates through every analysis he makes of the world. In this podcast, we trace out the history of the various ideological\nmovements that led up to the current political moment. In doing so, we mention a\nlarge number of amazing books. We'll put a link to\nthem in the description for those interested to\nlearn more about each topic. This is a \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere is Saagar Enjeti. So let's start with the\nobvious big question. Why do you think Trump won? Let's break it down. Before the election, you\nsaid that if Trump wins, it's going to be because of immigration. - Hmm.\n- So aside from immigration, what are the maybe less than\nobvious reasons that Trump won? - Yes, we absolutely need\nto return to immigration, but without that multifaceted explanation, let's start with the easiest one. There has been a wave\nof anti-incumbent energy around the world. Financial Times chart\nrecently went viral showing, so the first time, I\nthink since World War II, possibly since 1905, I need\nto look at the dataset, that all anti-incumbent\nparties all across the world suffered major defeat. So that's a very, very high level analysis and we can return to that if we talk about Donald Trump's victory in 2016 'cause there were similar\nlike global precursors. That individual level\nin the United States, there's a very simple explanation as well, which is that Joe Biden was very old, he was very unpopular, inflation was high. Inflation is one of\nthe highest determiners of people switching their votes and of putting their primacy on that ahead of any other\nissue at the ballot box. So that's that, but I think\nit's actually much deeper at a psychological level for\nwho America is and what it is. And fundamentally, I think\nwhat we're gonna spend a lot of time talking about\ntoday is the evolution of the modern left and its collapse in the Kamala Harris candidacy and eventually, the loss to\nDonald Trump in the popular vote where really is like an apotheosis\nof several social forces. So we're gonna talk about\nthe great awakening, or so-called awokening,\nwhich is very important to understanding all of this. There's also really Donald Trump himself, who was really one of the most unique individual American politicians\nthat we've seen in decades. At this point, Donald\nTrump's victory makes him the most important and\ntransformative figure in American politics since FDR. And a thought process for\nthe audience is, in 2028, there will be an 18-year-old\nwho's eligible to vote, who cannot remember a time when Donald J. Trump was not\nthe central American figure. And there's stories in World War II where troops were on the front lines. Some of they were 18, 19 years old, FDR died and they literally said, \"Well, who's the president?\" And they said, \"Harry\nTruman, you dumb ass.\" And they go, \"Who?\" They couldn't conceive of a universe where FDR was not the\npresident of the United States. And, you know, Donald Trump, even during the Biden\nadministration, he was the figure. Joe Biden defined his entire candidacy and his legacy around defeating this man and obviously, he's failed. We should talk a lot\nabout Joe Biden as well for his own failed\ntheories of the presidency. So I think, at a macro level, it's easy to understand. At a basic level, inflation,\nit's easy to understand. But what I really hope that a\nlot of people can take away is how fundamentally unique Donald Trump is as a political figure and\nwhat he was able to do to realign American\npolitics really forever. I mean in the white\nworking class realignment originally of 2016, the activation really of a multiracial kind of working class coalition and of really splitting American lines along a single individual\nquestion of did you attend a four-year college\ndegree institution or not? And this is a crazy thing to say, Donald Trump is one of the\nmost racially depolarizing electoral figures in American history. We lived in 2016 at a time\nwhen racial groups, you know, really voted in blocks,\nLatinos, Blacks, whites. There was some, of course, division between the white working class and the white college\neducated, white collar workers. But by and large, you\ncould pretty fairly say that Asians were gonna, Indians, everyone, 80, 90% were gonna vote\nfor the Democratic Party. Latinos as well. I'm born, you know, here in\nTexas, in the State of Texas, George W. Bush shocked\npeople when he won some 40% of the Latino vote. Donald Trump just beat\nKamala Harris with Latino men and he ran up the table for young men. So really fundamentally, we have witnessed a full\nrealignment in American politics. And that's a really fundamental problem for the modern left is erase a lot of the conversation\naround gerrymandering, around the electoral college, the so-called electoral college\nbias towards Republicans. Really the, being able\nto win the popular vote for the first time since 2004 is shocking and landmark achievement by a Republican. In 2008, I have a book\non my shelf and I never, and I always look at it to remind myself how much things can change, James Carville and it\nsays \"40 More Years,\" how Democrats will never\nlose an election again. 2008, they wrote that book\nafter the Obama coalition and the landslide. And something I love so\nmuch about this country, people change their minds all the time. I was born in 1992, I\nwatched red states go blue, I've seen blue states go red. I've seen swing states go red or blue. I've seen millions of\npeople pick up and move the greatest internal\nmigration in the United States since World War II. And it's really inspiring because it's a really\ndynamic, interesting place. And I love covering and\nI love thinking about it, talking about it, talking to people. It's awesome. - One of the reasons I'm\na big fan of yours is you're a student of history and so you've recommended a\nbunch of books to me and they, and others thread the different movements throughout American history. Some movements take off and\ndo hold power for a long time. Some don't and some are started\nby a small number of people and are controlled by a\nsmall number of people, some are mass movements and it's just fascinating to watch how those movements evolve and then fit themselves\nmaybe into the constraints of a two-party system. And I'd love to sort of talk about the various perspectives of that. So would it be fair to say\nthat this election was turned into a kind of class struggle? - Well, I won't go that far because to say it's a class\nstruggle really implies that things fundamentally\nalign on economic lines. And I don't think that's\nnecessarily accurate. Although if that's your\nlens, you could get there. So there's a very big statistic\ngoing around right now where Kamala Harris\nincreased her vote share and won households over $100,000 or more, and Donald Trump won\nhouseholds under 100,000. So you could view that\nin an economic lens. The problem again that I have is that that is much more a proxy for four-year college\ndegree and for education. And so one of my favorite\nbooks is called \"Coming Apart\" by Charles Murray. And that book really, really underscores how the cultural milieu\nthat people swim in when they attend a\nfour-year college degree and the trajectory of their life, not only on where they\nmove to, who they marry, what type of grocery store\nthey go to, their cultural, what television shows that they watch. One of my favorite questions from Charles Murray is\ncalled a \"Bubble Quiz.\" I encourage people to\ngo take it by the way, which it asks you a question. It's like, what does the\nword Branson mean to you? And it has a couple of answers. One of them is Branson is Richard Branson, Sir Richard Branson. Number two is Branson, Missouri, which is like a country music\ntourist style destination. Three is, it means nothing. So you are less in a bubble\nif you say country music. And you're very much in the bubble if you say Richard Branson. And I remember taking that\ntest for the first time, I go, \"Obviously, Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic, like what?\" And then I was like, \"Wait,\nI'm like, I'm in the bubble.\" And there are other things in there like, can you name various\ndifferent military ranks? I can 'cause I'm a history\nnerd but the vast majority of college educated people\ndon't know anybody served in the United States military. They don't have family members who do. The most popular shows in America are like \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"NCIS.\" Whereas people in our\nprobably cultural milieu, our favorite shows are \"White\nLotus,\" \"The Last of Us.\" This is prestige television, right, with a very small audience, but\nhigh income, high education. So the point is, is that culture\nreally defines who we are as Americans where we live. And rural urban is one way to describe it, but honestly with the\nwork from home revolution and more rich people and highly educated people\nmoving to more rural suburban or areas they traditionally\nweren't able to commute in, that's changing. And so really, and the\ninternet is everything. The stuff that you\nconsume on the internet, the stuff that you spend your time doing, type of books you read, whether you read a book at all, frankly, whether you travel to Europe,\nwhether you have a passport, you know, all the things\nthat you value in your life, that is the real cultural\ndivide in America. And I actually think that's what, this revolution of Donald\nTrump was activating and bringing people to the polls, bringing a lot of those\ntraditional working class voters of all races away from\nthe Democratic Party along the lines of elitism, of sneering, and of a general cultural feeling that these people don't understand me and my struggles in this life. - And so the trivial formulation\nis that is the wokeism, the anti-wokeism movement. - Yeah.\n- So it's not necessarily that Trump winning was a\nstatement against wokeism, it was the broader anti-elitism. - It's difficult to say\nbecause I wouldn't dismiss anti-wokeism or wokeism as an explanation. But we need to understand like the electoral impacts of woke. So there's varying degrees of like how you're going to encounter\nquote unquote \"wokeism.\" And this is a very\ndifficult thing to define. So let me just try and break it down, which is there are the types of things that you're going to interact\nwith on a cultural basis. And what I mean by that is\ngoing to watch a TV show and just for some reason there's\nlike two trans characters and it's never like\nparticularly explained why, they just are there, or\nwatching a commercial and it's the same thing. Watching, I don't know, I\nremember I was watching, I think it was \"Dr. Strange\nin the Multiverse of Madness\" and the main, it was a\nterrible movie by the way, I don't recommend it. But one of the characters, I think is, her name was like America and she wore a gay pride flag, right? Look, many left-wingers\nwould make fun of me for saying these things, but that is obviously a\nsocial agenda to the point as in they believe it is like\ndeeply acceptable that is used by Hollywood and cultural elites who really value those progress, you know, in sexual orientation and others, really believe it's important to quote unquote \"showcase\"\nit for representation. So that's like one way\nthat we may encounter quote unquote \"wokeism,\" but the more important\nways, frankly, are the ways that affirmative action,\nwhich really has its roots in, you know, American society\nall the way going back to the 1960s and how those\nhave manifested in our economy and in our understanding of\nquote unquote \"discrimination.\" So two books I can recommend. One is called \"The Origins of Woke,\" that's by Richard Hanania. There's another one by\n\"The Age of Entitlement\" by Christopher Caldwell. And they make a very strong case that, Caldwell in particular, that he calls it like a new founding of\nAmerica, was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it created an\nentire new legal regime and understanding of race\nin the American character and how the government\nwas going to enforce that. And that really ties in with\nanother one of the books that I recommended to you\nabout the origins of Trump by Jim Webb. And Senator Jim Webb.\nincredible, incredible man. He's so underappreciated. Intellectual, he was anti-war and he was, people may remember\nhim from the 2016 primary and they asked him, they'd asked him a question, I don't exactly remember\nabout one of his enemies. And he is like, \"Well,\none of them was a guy I shot in Vietnam.\" And he was running against Hillary. And that guy the, he wrote\nthe book \"Born Fighting,\" I think it's history of\nthe Scots-Irish people, something like that. And that book really\nopened my eyes to the way that affirmative action\nand racial preferences that were playing out, you know, through the HR, managerial elite, really turned a lot of people\nwithin the white working class away from the Democratic Party and felt fundamentally\ndiscriminated against by the professional managerial class. And so there's a lot of roots to this, \"The Managerial Revolution\"\nby James Burnham. And in terms of the origin\nof kind of how we got here, but the crystallization of like DEI and/or affirmative action, I prefer to use the\nterm affirmative action, in the highest echelons of business. And there became this idea that representation itself was\nthe only thing that mattered. And I think that right around 2014 that really went on steroids. And that's why it's not an accident Donald J. Trump elected in 2016. - At this point. Do you think this election\nis the kind of statement that wokeism as a movement is dead? - I don't know. I mean it's very difficult to say because wokeism itself is not a movement with a party leader. It's a amorphous belief\nthat has worked its way through institutions now\nfor almost 40 or 50 years. I mean, it's effectively a religion and part of the reason why it's difficult to find is it means done different things to different people. So for example, there are varying degrees of how we would define\nquote unquote \"woke.\" Do I think that the\nDemocrats will be speaking in so-called academic language? Yes, I do think they will. I think that the next democratic\nnominee will not do that. However, Kamala Harris actually did move as much as she could away\nfrom quote unquote \"woke\" but she basically was\npunished for a lot of the sins of both herself from 2019, but a general cultural feeling that her and the people around\nher do not understand me and not only do not understand me, but have racial preferences or a regime or an understanding that would lead to a quote unquote \"equity mindset,\" you know, equal outcomes for everybody as opposed to equality of opportunity, which is more of a colorblind philosophy. So I can't say, I think it's way too early and, you know, again, like you\ncan not use the word Latinx, but do you still believe in an effective affirmative action regime? You know, in terms of how you would run your Department of Justice? In terms of how you view the world? In terms of what you think\nthe real dividing lines in America are? 'Cause I would say that's still actually kind of a woke mindset. And that's part of the\nreason why the term itself doesn't really mean a whole lot. And we have to get\nactually really specific about what it looks like in operations. In operation, it means affirmative action, it means the Nasdaq passing some law that if you wanna go public or something, that you have to have a woman and a person of color on your board. Like this is a blatant and\nextraordinary look racialism that they've enshrined in their bylaws. So you can get rid of ESG, that's great, but, you know, you can get rid\nof DEI, I think that's great, but it's really about a\nmindset and a view of the world and I don't think that's going anywhere. - And you think the reason\nit doesn't work well in practice is because it, there's a big degree to\nwhich it's anti-meritocracy, - It's anti-American, really. I mean, you know, DEI and woke, and affirmative action make perfect sense in a lot of different countries, okay? There are a lot of countries out there that are multi-ethnic\nand they're heterogeneous and they were run by\nbasically quasi dictators. And the way it works is that\nyou pay off the Christians and they pay off the Muslims\nand they get this guy and they get that guy and\neverybody kinda shakes it. It's very explicit where they're like, we have 10 spots and they\ngo to the Christians, we have 10 spots, and\nthere goes the Hindus, you know, I'm talking, India's a country I know pretty well and this does kind of work like that on state politics level in some respect. But in America, you know,\nfundamentally, we really believe that no matter where you\nare from that you come here and basically, within a generation, especially if you migrate here legally and you integrate that you leave\na lot of that stuff behind. And the story, the American\ndream that is ingrained in so many of us is one that\nreally does not mesh well with any sort of racial preference regime or anything that's not meritocratic. And I mean, I will give\nthe left-wingers some, you know, credit in the idea\nthat meritocracy itself, you know, could have preference for people who have privileged backgrounds. I think that's true. And so, you know, the way I would like to\nsee it is to increase everybody's equality of opportunity to make sure that they all have a chance at quote unquote \"willing\nout the American dream.\" But that doesn't erase\nmeritocracy, hard work, and many of the other\nthings that we associate with the American character,\nwith the American frontier. So these are two ideologies\nwhich are really at odds, like in a lot of ways,\nlike wokeism, racialism, and all this is a third world ideology. It's one that's very prevalent in Europe and in all across Asia but\nit doesn't mix well here. And it shouldn't and I'm really glad that the America feels the same way. - Yeah, I got to go back\nto Jim Webb in that book. What a badass, fascinating book. - [Saagar] Oh, my God. It's the most amazing.\n- \"Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America.\" So I did not realize to the degree, first of all how badass\nthe Scots-Irish are and that to the degree, many of the things that\nkind of identify as American and part of the American\nspirit were defined by this relatively small group of people.\n- Yes, yeah. - As he describes the\nmotto could be summarized as fight, think, drink and pray. So there's the principles\nof fierce individualism, the principles of a deep distrust\nof government, the elites, the authorities, bottom-up governance, over 2000 years of a military tradition, they made up 40% of the\nRevolutionary War army and produced numerous military leaders including Stonewall\nJackson, Ulysses S. Grant, George S. Patton, and\na bunch of presidents. - Yeah. - Some of the more gangster presidents, Andrew Jackson, Teddy\nRoosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. - Hmm.\n- Just the, the whole cultural\nlegacy of country music. - We owe them so much and they really don't get\ntheir due, unfortunately. A lot of big, for the\nreasons that I just described around racialism is because post, you know, mass\nimmigration from Europe, the term white kind of became\nblanket applied to new Irish, to Italians, to Slovenians. And, you know, as you and I both know, if you travel those countries,\npeople are pretty different. And it's not different\nhere in the United States, Scots-Irish are some of\nthe original settlers here in America, and\nparticularly in Appalachia, and their contribution\nto the fighting spirit and their own culture and like\nwho we are as individualists and some of the first people\nto ever settle the frontier. And that frontier mindset\nreally does come from them. We owe them just as\nmuch we do the Puritans but they don't ever really get their due. And the reason I recommend that book is if you read that book\nand you understand then, you know, how exactly could this group of white working class\nvoters forgo from 2012 voting for a man named Barack Hussein\nObama to Donald J. Trump. You really seem to, it makes\nperfect sense if you combine it with a lot of the stuff\nI'm talking about here, about affirmative action,\nabout distrust of the elites, about feeling as if institutions\nare not seeing through to you and specifically also\nnot valuing your contribution to American history. And in some cases, actively looking down. You know, I'm glad you pointed\nout not only their role in the Revolutionary War but\nin the Civil War as well. And, you know, just how\nmuch of a contribution culturally really that we owe them for setting the groundwork\nthat so many of us who came later could build upon and adopt some of their own ideas and their culture as our own. It's one of the things\nthat makes America great. - Mark Twain.\n- Yeah. - I mean, so much of the\nculture, so much of the, yeah, the American spirit, the\nwhole idea, the whole shape and form and type of populism\nthat represents our democracy. So you, would you trace\nthat fierce individualism that we think of back to them? - Definitely, it's a huge part\nof them about who they were, about the screw-you attitude. I mean, that book actually\nkind of had a renaissance back in 2016 when\n\"Hillbilly Elegy\" came out. - Oh, yeah.\n- I'm sure you remember this. Which, it's kind of\nweird to think that he, he's now the Vice President-elect\nof the United States. It's kind of wild,\nhonestly to think about. But JD Vance's book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" I think was really important\nfor a lot of American elites who were like, \"How do\nthese people support Trump?\" \"Where does this shit come from?\" That they really, I mean that if you really think back to\nthat time, it was shocking to the elite character that any person in the\nworld could ever vote for Donald Trump and, not just\nvote, he won the election. How does that happen? And that's \"Hillbilly Elegy\" guided people in an understanding of what that's like on a\nlived day-to-day basis. And JD, to his credit, talks\nabout Scots-Irish heritage about Appalachia and the legacy of what that culture looks like today and how a lot of these people\nvoted for Donald Trump, but we got to give credit to\nJim Webb who wrote the history of these people and taught me and you about, you know, their original fight against the oppressors\nin Scotland, in Ireland and their militant spirit and how they were able\nto bring that over here. And, you know, they got\ntheir due in Andrew Jackson and some of our other populous presidents who set us up on the road to Donald Trump to where we are today. - Dude, you got me pumped,\nexcited to be an American. - Me too, I love that book. - It's crazy that JD, the same guy, because that's, \"Hillbilly\nElegy\" is what I kind of thought of him as. - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'll tell you, for me, it's actually pretty surreal. I met JD Vance in like 2017. I didn't ever, in like a bar, I didn't ever think he would\nbe the vice president-elect of the United States. I mean, just kind of wild. One of my friends went back and dug up the email that we originally sent him, just like, \"Hey, do you wanna meet up?\" And he was like, \"Sure,\"\nyou know, okay. (laughs) And I was watching on television. I mean, the first time\nthat it really hit me, I was like, \"Whoa, and he's\nlike name in a history book.\" It's whenever he became the\nvice presidential nominee, I was watching him on TV\nand the confetti was falling and he was waving with his\nwife and I was like, \"Wow.\" Like, that's it, you're in, you're in the history books now forever, especially now so as the\nliteral vice president-elect of the U.S. But his own evolution is\nactually a fascinating, a fascinating story for us too. Because I think a lot of the time I've spent right now is kind of, this, a lot of what I'm giving\nright now are like 2016 kind of takes about\nlike why Trump won that time. But we just spent a lot of time on how Donald Trump won this election and like how, what happened,\nsome of the failures of the Biden administration, some of the payback for\nthe great awokening. But also if you look at\nthe evolution of JD Vance, this is a person who\nwrote \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" And not a lot of people\npay attention to this, but if you read \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" JD was much more of a traditional\nconservative at that time. He was citing, you know, report. I think the famous passage\nis about like payday loans and why they're good\nor something like that. I don't know his position today, but I would assume that\nhe's probably changed that. But the point is, is that\nhis ideological evolution from watching somebody who really was more of a traditional Republican\nwith a deep empathy for the white working class\nthan eventually become a champion and a disciple of Donald Trump. And to believe that he\nhimself was the vehicle for accomplishing and\nbettering the United States, but specifically for\nworking class Americans, really of all stripes. And that story is really one\nof the rise of the modern left as it exists as a political\nproject, as an ideology. It's also one of the Republican\nparty which coalesced now with Donald Trump as a legitimate figure and as the single bulwark\nagainst cultural leftism and elitism that eventually\nwas normalized to the point that majority of Americans\ndecided to vote for him in 2024. - So let's talk about 2024. What happened with the left? What happened with Biden? What's your take on Biden? - Biden is, I try to remove myself from it and I try not to give\nlike hit big history takes while you're in the moment. But it's really hard not to say that he's one of the worst\npresidents in modern history. And I think the reason why I'm\ngonna go with it is because I wanna judge him by the\nthings that he set out to do. So Joe Biden has been the same person for his entire political career. He is a basically C student\nwho thinks he's an A student. The chip on his shoulder\nagainst the elites has played to his benefit in his original election to the United States Senate through his entire career\nas a United States Senator, where he always wanted to be the star and the center of attention and to his 1988 presidential campaign. And one of the most\nfascinating things about Biden and watching him age is\nwatching him become even more of what he already was. And so, book recommendation,\nit's called \"What It Takes.\" And it was written in 1988 and there's actually a\nlong chapter on Joe Biden and about the plagiarism scandal. And one of the things that comes across is his sheer arrogance and belief in himself as to why he should be\nthe center of attention. Now the reason I'm laying all this out is the arrogance of Joe Biden, the individual and his character\nis fundamentally the reason that his presidency went awry. This is a person who was elected in 2020, really because of a feeling\nof chaos of Donald Trump, of we need normalcy, decides to come into the\noffice, portrays himself as a quote unquote\n\"transitional president.\" Slowly, you know, begins to\nlose a lot of his faculties and then surrounds\nhimself with sycophants, the same ones who have been\naround him for so long, that he had no single input\ninto his life to tell him that he needed to stop and he\nneeded to drop out of the race until it became truly\nundeniable to the vast majority of the American people. And that's why I'm trying to keep it as like him as an\nindividual, as a president, 'cause we could separate him from some of his accomplishments and the things that happened on, some I support, some I don't. But generally a lot of people\nare not gonna look back and think about Joe\nBiden and the CHIPS Act. A lot of people are not gonna look back and think about Joe Biden and\nthe Build Back Better Bill or whatever his Lina\nKhan Antitrust policy. They're going to look back on him and they're going to\nremember high inflation. They're going to remember somebody who fundamentally never was up to the job in the sense that, one of, again, book recommendation, \"Freedom from Fear,\" by David Kennedy is about\nthe Roosevelt years. And one of the most important things people don't understand is the\nNew Deal didn't really work in the way that a lot of\npeople wanted it to, right? Like there was still high unemployment, there was still a lot of suffering, but you know what changed? They felt that they had a\nvigorous commander-in-chief who was doing everything in his\npower to attack the problems of the everyday American. So even though things didn't\neven materially change the vigor, that's a term\nthat was often associated with John F. Kennedy at vigah, you know, in the Massachusetts accent. We had this young\nvibrant president in 1960 and he was running around\nand he wanted to convince us that he was working every\nsingle day tirelessly. And when you have an 80-year-old man who is simply just eating ice cream and going to the beach while\npeople's grocery prices and all this thing go up by 25% and we don't see the same vigor, we don't see the same\naction, the bias to action, which is so important in\nthe modern presidency, that is fundamentally\nwhy I think the Democrats part of the reason why the\nDemocrats lost the election and also why I think\nthat he missed his moment in such a dramatic way. And he had the opportunity,\nhe could have done it, you know, if he wanted to,\nbut maybe 20 years ago, but the truth is that his own narcissism, his own misplaced belief in himself and his own accidental rise to the presidency ended\nup in his downfall. And it's kind of amazing because again, if we look back to his original campaign speech 2019, why I'm running for president,\nit was Charlottesville. And he said, \"I want to\ndefeat Donald Trump forever and I wanna make sure\nthat he never gets back in the White House again.\" So by his own metric, he did fail. That was his, it was the\nonly thing he wanted to do. And he failed them, he failed from. - You said a lot of interesting stuff. - Yeah.\n- So one FDR that's really interesting. It's not about the specific policy, it's about like fighting for the people and doing that with charisma and just uniting the entire country for a, this is the same with Bernie.\n- Yeah. - Like maybe there's a lot of people that disagree with Bernie that still supporting him 'cause like, we just want somebody-\n- He feels authentic. - Yeah.\n- That's it. - We just want somebody\nto fight authentically for us.\n- Yes. Yes, FDR, people really\nneed, FDR was like a king. He was like Jesus\nChrist, okay, in the U.S. and some of it was because of what he did, but it was just the fight. So people need to go back and read the history of the\nfirst 100 days under FDR, the sheer amount of\nlegislation that went through, his ability to bring Congress\nto heel and the Senate. He gets all this stuff through. But as you and I know, legislation takes a long time\nto put into place, right? We've had people starving on the streets all throughout 1933 under Hoover. The difference was Hoover was\nseen as this do nothing joke who would dine nine course\nmeals in the White House. And he is a filthy rich banker. FDR comes in there and every single day\nhas seen fireside chats, he's passing legislation, but more importantly, so he tries various different programs, then they get ruled unconstitutional. He tries even more. So what does America take away from that? Every single time, if he gets knocked down,\nhe comes back fighting. And that was a really\npart of his character that he developed after he got polio. And it was, it gave him the\nstrength to persevere through personally what he could\ntransfer in his calm demeanor and his feeling of fight that America really got that spirit from him and was able to climb itself\nout of the Great Depression. He's such an inspirational figure. He really is. And people think of him for World War II of course, you know, we\ncan spend forever on that. But in my opinion, the early\nyears are not studied enough. '33 to '37 is one of the\nmost remarkable periods in American history. We were not ruled by a president. We were ruled by king, by a\nmonarch, and people liked it. He was a dictator and he was a good one. - Yeah, so to sort of push\nback against the implied thing that you said. - Sure.\n- So when saying Biden is the worst president- - No second worst in modern history, that's what I said. Second-\n- In modern history. - Yeah.\n- Who's the worst? - W. with no question. - I see. Because of the\nhorrible wars probably. - [Saagar] I mean Iraq is just so bad. - It is just mess, yeah.\n- Like a, One of my favorite authors\nis a guy, Jean Edward Smith. He's ruined a bunch of\npresidential biographies and in the opening of his\nW biography, he's like, there's just no question this is a single worst\nforeign policy mistake in all of American history. And W is one of our worst presidents ever. He had terrible judgment\nand got us into a war of his own choosing. It was a disaster and it\nset us up for failure. By the way, we talked a\nlot about Donald Trump. Nobody is more responsible for the rise of Donald Trump than George W. Bush. But I could go off on\nBush for a long time. Oh we will.\n- Yeah. - We will return there.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- So as part of the pushback I'd like to say 'cause I\nagree with your criticism of arrogance and narcissism\nagainst Joe Biden. The same could be said about Donald Trump. - You're absolutely right.\n- Of arrogance. - Yeah.\n- So, and I think you've also articulated\nthat a lot of presidents throughout American history have suffered from a bad case of\narrogance and narcissism. - Absolutely, but sometimes fewer benefit, you know, you have to be a\npretty crazy person to be, to wanna be president. I, you know, I had put out a tweet that got some controversy, and I think it was Joe Rogan who I love, but he was like, \"I wanna find out who Kamala Harris is as a human being.\" And I was like, I'm\nactually not interested in who politicians are\nas human beings at all. I was like, I've read too\nmuch about them to know, I know who you are. If you spend your life and because I live in Washington and I spend a lot of time\naround would be politicians, I know what it takes to\nactually become the president. It's crazy. You have to give up everything, everything. Every night, you're not\nspending it with your wife. You're spending it at dinner\nwith potential donors, with friends, with people\nwho can connect you every, even after you get elected, that's even more so, now\nyou got to raise money and now you're onto the next thing. Now you wanna get your\npolitical thing through, you're gonna spend all\nyour time on your phone. You and your staff are\ngonna be more like this. Your entire life revolves\naround your career. It's honestly, you need an\ninsane level of narcissism to do it because you have to believe that you are better than everybody else, which is already pretty crazy. And not only that, your own\npersonal characteristics and foibles lead you to\nthe pursuit of this office and to the pursuit of\nthe idolatry of the self and everything around you. There's a famous story\nof Lady Bird Johnson after Johnson becomes the president and he's talking to\nthe White House butler. And she was like, \"Everything\nin this house revolves around my husband. Whatever's left goes to the\ngirls,\" her two children, \"and I'll take the scraps.\" So everything revolved around Johnson's political career and his daughters, when they're honest, 'cause they like to paper\nover some of the things that happened under him, but they didn't spend any time with him. Saturday morning was for\nbreakfast with, you know, Richard Russell, I forget, these are all in the Robert A. Caro books. Sunday was for Rayburn. There was no time for,\nyou know, for his kids. That's what it was. And by the way, he's one\nof the greatest politicians to ever live, but he also died from\na massive heart attack. And he was a deeply sad\nand depressed individual. - Yeah, I saw that tweet\nto go back to that. - Yeah.\n- And also I listened to your incredible debate about it with Marshall on \"The\nRealignment\" podcast. And I have to side with Marshall. - Okay.\n- I think you're just wrong on this.\n- All right. - Because I think revealing the character of a person is really\nimportant to understand how they will act in a\nroom full of generals and full of-\n- Yeah. This gets to the judgment question. - The judgment.\n- And that's, I think of Johnson and of Nixon, of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR, I can give you a laundry\nlist of personal problems that all those people had. I think they had a really,\nreally good judgment. And I'm not sure how intrinsic their own\npersonal character was to their exploration and\nthinking about the world. So JFK is actually, JFK\nmight be our best example because he had the best judgment\nout of anybody in a room as a brand new president in\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis. And he got us out and avoided nuclear war, which he deserves eternal credit for that. But how did he arrive to good judgment? Some of it certainly was his character. And we can go again though\ninto his laundry list of that. But most of it was around\nbeing with his father, seeing some of the mistakes\nthat he would make. And he was also had a\ndeeply inquisitive mind and he experienced World War II at the personal level after PT-109. So it is, look, I get it. I actually could steel man and I could, the response to what I'm saying\nis judgment is not divisible from personal character. But just because I know\na lot of politicians, and I've read enough with\nthe really great ones, the people who I revere the most. There's really bad personal stuff basically every single time. - But you're saying the judgment was good. - His judgment was great. His judgment was great.\n- On through a missile crisis. - Yes.\n- Some of the best judgment and decision-making in\nthe history of America. - Yes, and we should study a lot of it. And I encourage people out there, this is a brutal text. We were forced to read\nit in graduate school, the \"Essence of Decision\"\nby Graham Allison. I'm so thankful we did. It's one of the foundations\nof political science because it lays out theories\nof how government works. This is also a useful\ntransition, by the way, if we want to talk about\nTrump and some of his cabinet and how bad it's shaping up because people really need\nto understand Washington. Washington is a creature with traditions, with institutions that\ndon't care about you. They don't even really\ncare about the president. They have self-perpetuating mechanisms which have been done a certain way. And it usually takes\na great shocking event like World War II to\nchange really anything beyond the marginal. Every once in a while you have\na figure like Teddy Roosevelt who's actually able to\ntake peacetime presidency and transform the country. But it needs an extraordinary individual to get something like that done. So the question around the essence of decision was the theory\nbehind the Cuban Missile Crisis of how Kennedy arrived at his decision. And there are various\ndifferent schools of thought, but one of the things I love\nabout the book is it presents a case for all three, the\norganizational theory, the bureaucratic politics theory, and then kind of the\ngreat man theory as well. So there's a, you know,\nyou and I could sit here and I could tell you a case about PT-109 and about how John F. Kennedy\nexperienced World War II as this, I think he was\nlike a first lieutenant or something like that. And how he literally swam miles with a wounded man's life\njacket strap in his teeth with a broken back and he saved him. And he ended up on the\ncover of Life Magazine. And he was a war hero. And he was a deeply smart individual who wrote a book in 1939\ncalled \"Why England Slept,\" which to this day is considered a text, which at the moment was\nable to describe in detail why Neville Chamberlain and the British political system arrived at the policy of appeasement. I actually have a original copy, it's one of my most prized\npossessions because, and from 1939, because\nthis is a 23-year-old kid, who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy? Turns out he's a brilliant man. And another just favorite aside is that at the Potsdam Conference, you know, where Harry Truman is there with Stalin and everybody. So in the room at the same\ntime, Harry S. Truman, president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general, right, who will succeed him, 26-year-old John F.\nKennedy as a journalist, some shithead journalist on the side, and all three of those\npresidents were in the same room with Joseph Stalin and others. And that's the story\nof America right there. It's kind of amazing. And I loved people to say\nthat because you never know about who will end up rising to power. But-\n- Are you announcing that you're running for-\n- No, absolutely not. Yeah, yeah. - Okay.\n- I don't have what it takes. I don't think so, I'm self-aware. - Yeah, well, maybe humility\nnecessary for greatness. Okay, so yeah, actually, can\nwe just linger on that book? - Yeah.\n- So the book, \"Essence of Decision: Explaining\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis,\" by Graham Allison, it presents three different models of how government works. The Rational Actor Model, so seeing government as one entity, trying to maximize the national interest, also seeing government as\nthrough the lens of the momentum of standard operating procedures, sort of this giant organization\nthat's just doing things, how it's always been done, and the government politics model of there's just these individual internal power struggles within government. - Yes.\n- And all of that is like a different way to view, and they're probably all true to a degree of how decisions are made. - Yes.\n- Within this giant machinery of government. - That's why it's so important is because you cannot\nread that book and say one is true and one is not. You can say one is may\nmore true than the other, but all of them are deeply true. And this is one or this is\nprobably a good transition to Donald Trump because, and I guess for the people out there who think I've been up too obsequious, he'll be my criticism, Trump says something very fundamental and interesting on the Joe Rogan podcast, probably the most important\nthing that he ever said, which is he said, \"I like to\nhave people like John Bolton in my administration. Well, because they scare people and it makes me seem like\nthe most rational individual in the room.\" So at a very intuitive level, a lot of people can understand that. And then they can rationalize\nwhile there are picks that Donald Trump has\nbrought into his White House, people like Mike Waltz and\nothers that have espoused views that are directly at odds with\na quote unquote \"anti-neocon anti-Liz Cheney agenda.\" Now, Trump's theory of this is that he likes to have quote\nunquote \"like psychopaths\" like John Bolton in the room with him while he's sitting\nacross from Kim Jong Un, because it gets scared. What I think Trump never\nunderstood when he was president, and I honestly question\nif he still does now, is those two theories that you laid out, which are not about the rational interest as the government is one model, but the bureaucratic theory and the organizational theory of politics. And because what Trump I\ndon't think quite gets is that there are 99% of the decisions\nthat get made in government never reach the president's desk. One of the most important\nObama quotes ever is, \"By the time it gets to my\ndesk, nobody else can solve it. All the problems here are hard. All the problems here\ndon't have an answer. That's why I have to make the call.\" So the theory that Trump has, that you can have people in there who are, let's say war mongers,\nneocons or whatever, who don't necessarily\nagree with you is that when push comes to shove at\nthe most important decisions, that I'll still be able\nto reign those people in as an influence. Here's the issue. Let's say for Mike Waltz, who's gonna be the\nnational security advisor, a lot of people don't\nreally understand, you know, there's this theory of\nnational security advisor where you call me into your\noffice and you're the president you're like, \"Hey, what\ndo we think about Iran?\" And I'm like, \"I think you\nshould do X, Y, and Z.\" No, that's not how it works. The national security\nadvisor's job is to coordinate the inter-agency process. So his job is actually convene\nmeetings, him and his staff, where in the situation\nroom CIA, State Department, Sec Def, others before\nthe POTUS even walks in, we have options. So we're like, \"Hey, Russia\njust invaded Ukraine, weed a package of options Those packages options are\ngonna concede of three things. We're gonna have one group, we're gonna call it the dovish option, two, we're gonna call\nit the middle ground, three, the hardcore package.\" Trump walks in, this is\nhow it's supposed to work. Trump walks in and he goes,\n\"Okay, Russia invaded Ukraine. What do we do?\" \"Mr. President, we've prepared\nthree options for you. We've got one, two, and three.\" Now who has the power? Is it Trump when he\npicks one, two, or three? Or is the man who decides\nwhat's even in option one, two, and three? That is the part where Trump\nneeds to really understand how these things happen. And I watched this happen to him in his first administration. He hired a guy, Mike Flynn, who was his national security advisor. You could say a lot about Flynn, but him and Trump were at least\nlike this on foreign policy. Flynn gets outed because what I would call an\nFBI coup, whatever, 33 days, he's out as a national security advisor. H.R. McMaster, he's got\na nice, shiny uniform, four star, all of this, Master doesn't agree\nwith Donald Trump at all. And so Trump says, \"I ran on\npulling out of Afghanistan, I want to get out of Afghanistan.\" They're like, \"Yeah,\nwe'll get out Afghanistan, but before we get out we got to go back in as we need more troops in there.\" And he is like, \"oh, okay.\" You know, it's like all this\nand yeah, approves a plan and effectively gives a speech in 2017 where he ends up escalating and increasing the number\nof troops in Afghanistan. And it's only till February 2020 that he gets to sign a deal,\nthe Taliban peace deal. Which in my opinion, you\nshould have done in 2017. But the reason why that\nhappened was because of that organizational theory, of that\nbureaucratic politics theory where H.R. McMaster is able to guide the interagency process, bring the uniform recommendations of the joint chiefs of staff\nand others to give Donald Trump no option but to say we must put troops. Another example of this is a book called \"Obama's War\" by Bob Woodward. I highly encourage\npeople to read this book because this book talks about how Obama comes into\nthe White House in 2009 and he says, \"I wanna get out of Iraq and I don't wanna increase, I wanna fight the Good War\nin Afghanistan,\" right? And he's doing, Obama's a thoughtful guy too thoughtful actually. And so he sits there and he's\nworking out his opinions. And what he starts to watch is\nthat very slowly his narrow, his options begin to narrow because strategic leaks start to come out from the White House situation room about what we should do in Afghanistan. And pretty soon David\nPetraeus and Stan McChrystal and the entire national security\napparatus has Obama pegged where he basically politically\nat the time decides to take the advantage position of increasing troops in Afghanistan, but then tries to have it\nboth ways, but by saying, \"but in two years, we're gonna withdraw.\" That book really demonstrates how the deep state can completely remove any of your options to be\nable to move by presenting you with ones which you don't even want, and then making it politically\ncompletely infeasible to travel down the extreme directions. That's why when Trump says things like, \"I wanna get out of Syria,\" that doesn't compute up\nhere for the Pentagon, because first of all, you know, if I even asked you how many\ntroops we have in Syria, and you could go on the DOD website, it'll tell you a number. The number's bullshit, because the way that they do it is if you're only there for 179 days, you don't count as active\nmilitary contracts. The real numbers, let's say five times. And so Trump would be like,\n\"Hey, I wanna get out of Syria.\" They're like, \"Yeah, yeah,\nwe'll do it six months,\" right? We need six months and\nafter six months ago, so are we out of Syria yet? And they're like, \"No, well\nwe got to wrap this up. We got this base, we got that, and we have this important mission.\" And you know, next thing you know, you're out of office and it's over. So that, there's all these things which I don't think he quite understands. I know that some of the\npeople around him who disagree with these picks do is\nthe reason why these picks really matter is not only are the voices in the situation room for the really, really high profile stuff, it's for all the little things to never get to that president's desk of which can shape extraordinary policy. And I'll give you the best example. There was never a decision\nby FDR as president of the United States to oil embargo Japan. One, which he thought about as deeply as you and I would want. It was a decision kind of made\nwithin the State Department. It was a decision that was\nmade by some of his advisors. I think he eventually signed off on it. It was a conscious choice, but it was not one\nwhichever was understood the implications that by doing that we invite a potential\nresponse like Pearl Harbor. So think about, you know, what the organizational\nbureaucratic model can tell us about the extraordinary\nblowback that we can get and why we want people with great judgment all the way up and down the\nentire national security chain in the White House. Also, I just realized I did\nnot talk about immigration, which is so insane. One of the reasons\nDonald Trump won in 2024, of course was because\nof the massive change to the immigration status quo. The truth is, is that it may\nactually be second to inflation in terms of the reason that Trump did win the presidency was because Joe\nBiden fundamentally changed the immigration status\nquo in this country. That was another thing\nabout the Scots-Irish people and others that we need\nto understand is that when government machinery and elitism and liberalism appears\nto be more concerned about people who are\ncoming here in a disorderly and illegal process and about their rights and their, you know, ability to quote unquote\n\"pursue the American dream,\" while the American dream is dying for the native-born population, that is a huge reason\nwhy people are turning against mass immigration. Historically as well, my friend Reihan Salam wrote a book called \"Melting Pot or Civil War\" and one of the most important parts about that book is the history of mass migration to the United States. So if we think about the transition from Scots-Irish America to the opening of America to the Irish and to mass European immigration, what a lot of people\ndon't realize is it caused a ton of problems. There were mass movements at that time, the Know-Nothings and others in the 1860s who rose up against\nmass European migration, they were particularly\nconcerned about Catholicism by, as the religion of a lot\nof the new immigrants. But really what it was\nis about the changing of the American character by people who are not have the same traditions, values and skills as the\nnative-born population and their understanding\nof what they're owed and their role in American\nsociety is very different from the way that people previously had. One of the most tumultuous periods of U.S. politics was actually\nduring the resolution of the immigration question, where we had massive waves\nof foreign-born population come to the United States. We had them, you know, integrated, luckily, actually at the time with the Industrial Revolution. So we actually did have jobs for them. One of the problems is that\ntoday in the United States we have one of the highest levels of foreign-born population\nthan ever before, actually since that\ntime in the early 1900s, but we have all of the\nsame attendant problems. But even worse is we don't live in an industrial economy anymore. We live in a predominantly\nservice-based economy that has long, you know,\nmoved past manufacturing. Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't\nbring some of that back, but the truth is, is that\nmanufacturing today is not what it was to work in\na steel mill in 1875. I think we can all be reasonable\nand we can agree on that. And part of the problems\nwith extremely high levels of foreign-born population,\nparticularly unskilled, and the vast majority of the\npeople who are coming here and who are claiming asylum are doing so under fraudulent purposes. They're doing so because\nthey are economic migrants and they're abusing, you know, asylum law to basically gain entrance\nto the United States without going through a process\nof application or of merit. And this has, its all of\nits traces back to 1965 where the Immigration\nNaturalization Act of 1965 really reversed and changed\nthe status quo of immigration from the 1920s to 1960,\nwhich really shut down levels of immigration\nto the United States. In my opinion, it was one\nof the most important things that ever happened and one of the reasons why is it forced and caused integration. It also forced by\nslowing down the increase in the number of foreign-born population, it redeveloped an American character and an understanding\nthat was more homogenous and was the ability for\nyou and me to understand despite the difference in our background. If you accelerate and\nyou continue this trend of the very high foreign-born\nunskilled population, you unfortunately are basically\ncreating a mass, you know, it's basically it's a\nnon-citizen population of illegal immigrants. People who are not a skilled,\nyou know, I think it was, I read 27% of the people who've come under Joe Biden illegally don't\neven have a college degree. That means that we are lucky if they're even literate in\nSpanish, let alone English. So there are major\nproblems about integrating that type of person. You know, even in the past, whenever we had a mass industrial economy, now imagine today the amount of strain that would put on social services if mass citizenship happened, you know, to that population would be extraordinary. And even if we were to do, I\ndon't think it's a good idea, but even if we were to do so, we would still need to pair\nit with a dramatic change. And part of the problem right now is I don't think a lot of people understand the immigration system. The immigration system\nin the United States, effectively they call it\nfamily-based migration. I call it chain migration. Chain migration is the\nterm which implies that let's say you come over here and you get your green card, you can use sponsorship\nand others by gaming the quota system to get your cousin or whatever to be able to come. The problem with that\nis who is your cousin? Like is he a plumber? Is he, you know, is he a coder? You know, that doesn't actually matter 'cause he's your cousin so\nhe actually has preference. The way that it should\nwork is it should be, nobody cares if he's your cousin. What does he do? You know, what does she do? What is she gonna bring to this country? All immigration in the\nUnited States, in my opinion, should be net positive without\ndoing fake statistics about, oh, they actually increased\nthe GDP or whatever. It's like we need a\nmerit-based immigration system. We are the largest country in the world and one of the only non-Western or one of the only Western\ncountries in the world that does not have a merit-based points-based immigration\nsystem like Australia and or Canada. And I mean, I get it because\na lot of people did come to this country under\nnon-merit-based purposes. So they're really\nreluctant to let that go. But I do think that Biden, by changing the immigration status quo and by basically just allowing,\nyou know, tens of millions, potentially tens of millions\nat the very least 12 million, new entrants to come to the\nU.S. under these pretenses of complete disorder and of no conduct really broke a lot of\npeople's understanding and even like mercy in that regard. And so that was obviously a\nmassive part of Trump's victory. - Speaking of illegal immigration, what do you think about\nthe border are Tom Homan? - Tom Holman is a very legit dude, got to know him a little bit in Trump 1.0, he is an original, like true believer on enforcing\nimmigration law as it is. Now notice how I just said it that, that's a politically correct\nway of saying mass deportation. And I will point out from my\nleft-wing critics in that, yeah, he really believes in the ability, in the ability, in the\nnecessity of mass deportation. And he has the background to\nbe able to carry that out. I will give some warnings and\nthis will apply to DOGE too. Czar has no statutory or\nconstitutional authority. Czar has as much\nauthority as the president of the United States gives him. Donald Trump, I think it's\nfair to say even his critics or even the people who love him could say he can be capricious at times and he can strip you or not strip you or give you the ability to compel. So Czar in and of itself is\nfrankly a very flawed position in the White House and it's one that I really\nwish we would move away from. I understand why we do it. It's basically to do a\nnational security advisor interagency convener to\naccomplish certain goals. That said, there is a\nperson, Steven Miller, who will be in the White House, the Deputy White House Chief of Staff who has well-founded beliefs\nexperience in government and rock solid ideology on this, which I think would also\ngive him the ability to work with home and to pull that off. That said, a corollary to this, and frankly this is the one\nI'm the most mystified yet, is Kristi Noem, as the Department of\nHomeland Security Secretary. So let me just lay this out for people 'cause people don't know what this is. Department of Homeland\nSecurity, 90% of the time, the way you're gonna\ninteract with them is TSA, you don't think about it,\nbut people don't know, the Department of Homeland Security is one of the largest law enforcement\nif maybe the largest law enforcement agency in the world. It's gigantic. You have extraordinary statutory power to be able to prove investigations, you have border patrol, ICE, TSA, CBP, all these other agencies\nthat report up to you. But most importantly for this,\nyou will be the public face of mass deportation. So I was there in the\nWhite House briefing room last time around when Kirstjen Nielsen, who was the DHS secretary\nunder Donald Trump, and specifically the one who\nenforced child separation for a limited period of time. She was a smart woman. She has long experience in government and honestly she melted\nunder the criticism. Kristi Noem is the\ngovernor of South Dakota. I mean, that's great, you have a little bit\nof executive experience, but to be honest, I mean you have no law\nenforcement background. You have no ability to, you have no frankly with understanding of what it is going to be\nlike to be the secretary of one of the most controversial programs in modern American history. You have to go on television and defend that every single day. A literal job requirement\nunder Donald Trump. And you will have to have. extraordinary command of the facts. You have to have a very high intellect. You have to have the ability\nto really break through. And I mean, we all watch how\nshe handled that situation with her dog in her interviews. And that does not give me confidence that she will be able to do all that well in the position so.\n- What do you think is behind that? So crystal ball's theory\non breaking points- - Yeah.\n- Is that there's some kind of interpersonal, like I didn't know- - I can explain it.\n- I should know this, but I didn't know any of the- - Yeah.\n- There was some cheating or whatever.\n- There's a rumor nobody knows if it's true that Corey Lewandowski and Kristi Noem had a\nprevious relationship and ongoing Corey Lewandowski\nis a Trump official and that he maybe put her\nin front, I don't know. - Is this like the Real Housewives of DC? - Yeah, kind of, although, I mean it was the most open\nsecret in the world allegedly. I don't know if it's\ntrue. Okay, all right. I mean, I don't like to traffic too much in personal theories, but I mean, in this respect\nit might actually be correct in terms of how it all came down. I have no idea what he's\nthinking to be, I truly don't. I mean, maybe it's like\nhe was last time he said, \"I want a woman who's like\nsofter and like emotionally and the ability to be the face\nof my immigration program.\" I mean, again, like I said, I don't see it in terms of\nher experience and her media. It's frankly like not very good. - So you think she needs\nto be able to articulate, not just be like the softer\nface of this radical- - Yeah, so-\n- Policy, but also be able to articulate the what's\nhappening with the reasoning behind all that?\n- Yes. You need to give\njustification for everything. Here's the thing, under mass deportation, the media will drag up every sob story known to\nplanet Earth about this person and that person who came here illegally and why they deserve to stay. And really what the quasi thing is, that's why the program itself is bad. And we should legalize\neverybody who's here illegally. Okay, so the thing is, is\nthat you need to be able to have extraordinary oversight. You need a great team with you. You need to make sure that everything is being done by the book. The way that the media\nis being handled is that you throw every question\nback in their face and you say, well, you know,\nyou either talk about crime or you talk about the\nenforceability of the law, then necessity, I mean I just, I think articulated a very coherent case for why we need much less high levels of immigration to the United States. And I am the son of people who\nimmigrated to this country. But one of the favorite\nphrases I heard from this, from a guy named Mark Krikorian who's a center for immigration studies is we don't make immigration policy for the benefit of our grandparents. We make immigration policy for the benefit of our grandchildren. And that is an extraordinary\nand good way to put it. And in fact, I would say it's a triumph of the American system that somebody whose\nparent family benefited from the immigration regime\nand was able to come here. My parents had PhDs, came here legally, applied, spent thousands of\ndollars through the process, can arrive at the conclusion\nthat actually we need to care about all of our fellow American citizens. I'm not talking about other Indians or you know, other whatever. I'm talking about all of us. I care about everybody who\nis here in this country, but fundamentally, that will mean that we are going to have to exclude some people from the U.S. And I mean, another thing that the open borders people\ndon't ever really grapple with is that even within their own framework, it makes no sense. So for example, a common\nleft-wing talking point is that it's America's fault that\nEl Salvador and Honduras and Central America is fucked up. And so because of that,\nwe have a responsibility to take all those people in 'cause it's our fault or Haiti, right? But you know, if you think about\nit, America is responsible, and I'm just being honest for destroying and ruining a lot of countries. They just don't benefit from\nthe geographic like ability to walk to the United States. So I mean, if we're\ndoing grievance politics, Iraqis have way more of a\nclaim to be able to come here than anybody from El Salvador who's talking about something\nthat happened in 1982. So within its own logic,\nit doesn't make any sense. Even under the asylum\nprocess, you know, people, I mean, people don't even know this. You're literally able to claim asylum from domestic violence, okay? I mean, imagine that like that's frankly, that is a local law enforcement and problem of people\nwho are experiencing that in their home country. I know how cold-hearted this sounds, but maybe honestly it could\nbe because I'm Indian. One of the things that\nwhenever you visit India and you see a country with\nover a billion people, you're like, holy shit, you know this, this is crazy. And you understand both the sheer numbers of the amount of people involved. And also, there is nothing in\nthe world you could ever do to solve all problems for everybody. It's a very complex and dynamic problem. And it's really nice to be bleeding heart and to say, \"Oh, well, we\nhave responsibility to this and to all mankind and all that.\" But it's just, it doesn't work. It doesn't work with a nation state, it doesn't work with the sovereign nation. We're the luckiest people in the history of the world live here in this country. And you need to protect it. And protecting it requires really thinking about the\nfundamentals of immigration itself and not telling us stories. Like there's a famous moment\nfrom the Trump White House where Jim Acosta, CNN White\nHouse correspondent got into it with Stephen Miller,\nthe current, you know, who'll be the current deputy chief. And he was like, what do you say, something along the\nlines to people who say you're violating, you know, that quote on the Statue of Liberty, like give me, you're tired, you're poor, you're hungry, all of that, the Emma Lazarus quote, and Stephen very logically was like, what level of immigration comports with the Emma Lazarus quote? Is it 200,000 people a year? Is it 300? Is it 1 million? Is it 1.5 million? And that's such a great way of putting it because there is no limiting principle on Emma Lazarus quote. There is, when you start\ntalking, honestly, you're like, okay, we live in X, Y, and Z\nsociety with X, Y and Z GDP, people who are coming here\nshould be able to benefit for themselves and us not rely on welfare, not, you know, be people who\nwe have to take care of after because we have our own\nproblems here right now. And who are the population and the types of people that\nwe can study and look at who will be able to benefit? And based on that, yeah,\nimmigration is great, but there are a lot of economic, legal, and societal reasons for why you definitely don't\nwant the current level. But another thing is,\neven if we turn the switch and we still let in\n1,000,005 people a year under the chain family-based migration, I think it would be a colossal mistake because it's not rooted\nin the idea that people who are coming to America\nare explicitly doing so at the benefit of America. It's doing so based on the\nfamilial connections of people who already gamed the immigration system to be able to come here. I have a lot of family in India and you know, I love them, but, and some of them are actually\nvery talented and qualified. If they wanted to come here, I think they should be able\nto apply on their own merit. And that should have nothing to do with their familial status of the fact that I'm a U.S. citizen. - Like you mentioned the book\n\"Melting Pot or Civil War\" by Reihan Salam, he makes an argument against open borders. The thesis there is assimilation\nshould be a big part. I guess there's some kind of\noptimal rate of immigration which allows for assimilation. - Yeah, and there are ebbs and flows and that's kinda what I was\ntalking about historically where, you know, I mean the truth is, is you could walk the\nstreets of New York City in the early 1900s and late 1890s and you're not gonna hear any English. And I think that's bad. I mean, really what you\nhad was ethnic enclaves of people who were basically\npracticing their way of life just like they did previously, bringing over a lot of their\nethnic problems that they had and even some of their cultural\nlike unique capabilities or whatever, bringing it to America. And then New York City police and others are figuring out like, what the hell do we do with all this? And it literally took\nshutting down immigration for an entire generation\nto do away with that. And there's actually still some. The point about assimilation is twofold. One is that you should have the capacity to inherit the understanding\nof the American character that has nothing to do with race. And that's so unique that I can sit here as a child of people from India and has such a deep appreciation\nfor the Scots-Irish. I consider myself, you\nknow, American first. And one of the things that I\nreally love about that is that I have no historical\nrelationship to anybody who fought in the Civil War, but I feel such kinship with\na lot of the people who did and reading the memoirs and\nthe ideas of those that did, because that same mindset of the victors and the values that they were\nable to instill in the country for 150 years later gives me\nthe ability to connect to them. And that's such an incredible\nvictory on their part. And that's such a unique thing in almost every other\ncountry in the world, in China and India or wherever, you're kind of like what you are, you're a Hindu, you're a\nJew, you're a, you know, you're Han Chinese, you're a Uyghur, or you're Tibetan, something like that. You're born into it, but really here, one of the only places in the world where you can really connect to that story and that spirit and the compounding effect of all of these different\npeople who come to America. And that is a celebration\nof immigration as an idea. But immigration is also a discreet policy and that policy was really screwed up by the Biden administration. And so we can celebrate the idea and also pursue a policy for all of the people in\nthe U.S., our citizens, to actually be able to benefit and, look, it's gonna be messy. And honestly, I still don't know yet if Trump will be able to\npursue actual mass deportation just because I think that I'm not sure the public is ready for it. I do support mass deportation. I don't know if the\npublic is ready for it. I think, I don't know, I'll have to see, because there's a lot of\ndifferent ways that you can do it. There's mandatory E-Verify,\nwhich requires businesses to basically verify you're a U.S. citizen or you're here illegally\nwhenever they employ you. Which is not the law\nof the land currently, which is crazy by the way. There's, you know, you can cut off for tax remittance payments, which are payments that are sent back to other countries like Mexico,\nHonduras, and Guatemala. Again, illustrating my\neconomic migrant point. There are a lot of various different ways where you can just make it more difficult to be illegally here in the\nU.S. so people will self-deport, but you know, if he does pursue\nlike real mass deportation, that will be a flashpoint in America. - Aren't you talking about things like what Tom Holman said that works at raids, sort of increasing the rate of that? - Yeah, we used to do that, you know. - But.\n- Yeah, - But there's a rate at\nwhich you can do that, where it would lead to, I\nmean, radical social upheaval. - Yeah, it will, I mean, and I think some people\nneed to be honest here. And this actually flies in the face of, I mean one of the most\ncommon liberal critiques is this is gonna raise prices. And yeah, I think it's true. I think it's worth it. But that's easy for me to\nsay, I'm making a good living. If you care about inflation,\nyou voted for Donald Trump and your price of groceries\nor whatever goes up because of this immigration policy. I think that needs to be\nextremely well articulated by the president. And of course, he needs to think about it. The truth is is America right\nnow is built on cheap labor. It's not fair to the consumer, it's not fair to the immigrants, the illegal immigrants themselves. And it's not fair to the\nnatural-born citizen. The natural-born citizen\nhas his wages suppressed for competition by tens\nof millions of people who are willing to work at lower wages. They have to compete for\nhousing, for social services. I mean just even, you know, like basic stuff at a societal\nlevel, it's not fair to them. It's definitely not\nfair to the other person 'cause I mean when everyone, people say like who's gonna\nbuild your houses or whatever, you're endorsing this\nquasi-legal system where, you know, uninsured laborers from Mexico, they have no guarantee of wages. They're getting paid cash under the table. They are living, you know, 10 to a room. They're sending Mexican\nremittance payments back just so that their children can eat. I mean, that's not really\nfair to that person either. So that's the point. The point is, is that it will lead to a lot of social upheaval. But this gets to my Kristi\nNoem point as well is you need to be able to articulate a lot of what I just said here, because if you don't, it's\ngonna go south real quick. - The way that Vivek\narticulates this is that our immigration system\nis deeply dishonest. Like we don't acknowledge some\nof the things you just said. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah. - And he wants to make it honest. So if we don't do mass deportation, at least you have to be really honest about the living conditions\nof illegal immigrants, about basically mistreatment of them. - Yes, it's true, I mean, you know, if you support mass illegal migration, you're basically\nsupporting tens of millions who are living lives as\nsecond class citizens. That's not fair to them. I also think it's deeply paternalistic. So there's this idea that\nAmerica has so ruined these Central American countries that they have no agency whatsoever and they can never turn things around. What does that say about\nour confidence in them? You know, one of the things\nthey always say there, oh, they're law abiding, they're\ngreat people and all that. I agree, okay? By and large, I'm not\nsaying these are bad people, but I am saying like if they're not bad and they're law abiding and\nthey're citizens and thoughtful and all that, they can\nfix their own countries. And they did in El Salvador. That's the perfect example. Look at the dramatic\ndrop in their crime rate. Bukele is one of the most popular leaders in all of South America that is proof positive that\nyou can change things around despite perhaps the legacy\nof U.S. intervention. So you know, to just say\nthis idea that, you know, because it's America's fault\nthat they're screwed up, it takes agency away from them. You know, another really\nkey part of this dishonesty, this really gets to Springfield\nand the whole Haitian thing because everybody, you know, beyond the eating cats and dogs, everybody does not even acknowledge 'cause when they're like the\nHaitians are here legally, they need to actually\nthink about the program. The program is called TPS. So let me explain that. TPS is called temporary protected status, note, what's the first word in that? Temporary. What does that mean? TPS was developed under a regime in which, let's say that there was a catastrophic, I think this is a real example. I think there was like a volcano or an earthquake or something where people were granted TPS to come to the United States. And the idea was they were\ngonna go back after it was safe. They just never went back. There are children born\nin the United States today who are literally the descent, who are adults, who are\nthe descendants of people who are still living\nin the U.S. under TPS. That's a perfect example of\nwhat Vivek says is dishonest. You know, you can't mass\ndefacto legalize people by saying that they're here temporarily because of a program or because\nof something that happened in their home country when\nthe reality is is that in, for all intents and purposes, we are acknowledging them\nas full legal migrants. So you know, even the term migrant to these Haitians in\nSpringfield makes no sense 'cause they're supposed to be\nhere under TPS, that's not, migrant implies permanency. So the language is all dishonest. And people don't wanna\ntell you about the things I just said about chain migration. You know, the vast majority\nof Americans don't even know the immigration system works. They don't understand what\nI just said about TPS. They don't really understand\nthe insanity of asylum law where you can just literally\nthrow up your hands and say, \"I fear for my life.\" And you get to live here\nfor four, five years before your court date even happens. And you know, by that time,\nget a work permit or whatever, you can, you know, get housing like you just\nsaid in substandard conditions and you can kind of just\nplay the game and wait before a deportation order comes. And even if it does,\nyou never have to leave because there's no ICE agent or whatever who's gonna enforce it. So the whole system is nuts right now, and we need complete systematic reform that burns it all to the ground. - That said sort of the image and the reality of a child being separated from their parents seems\ndeeply un-American, right? - Well, I mean look, it\ngets, okay, so, you know, I'm not gonna defend it, but I'll just put it this way. Nobody-\n- Do you hate children? - Yeah. See, this is what I mean. Do you think twice whenever you see a drug\naddict who's put in prison and their child is put\nin protective services? Nobody in America thinks\ntwice about that, right? - Yeah.\n- So I mean, well, that's kind of screwed up. Well, what we should think about, why did we come to that conclusion? The conclusion was is that these adults willingly broke the law and pursued a path of life\nwhich put them on a, you know, which put them on a trajectory where the state had to\ncome in and determine that you are not allowed\nto be a parent basically to this child while you\nserve your debt to society. Now, child separation was very different. Child separation was also a product of extremely strange circumstances\nin U.S. immigration law, where basically at the time, the reason why it was happening was 'cause there was no\nway to prosecute people for illegal entry\nwithout child separation. Because previous doctrine, I believe it's called the\nFlores Doctrine under, it's some asylum law, people will have to go\ncheck my work on this. But basically, the whole reason this evolved is illegal regime was because people figured out that if you bring a kid with you because of the so-called\nFlores Doctrine or whatever, that you couldn't be\nprosecuted for illegal entry. So it was a defacto way\nof breaking the law. And in fact, a lot of people\nwere bringing children here who weren't even theirs, who weren't, they weren't even related\nto or couldn't even, you know, prove it. We're bringing them to get around the prosecution for illegal entry. So I'm not defending child separation, I think it was horrible or whatever. But you know, if I gave you the context, it does seem like a very tricky problem in terms of do we enforce the law or not, how are we able to do that. And the solution, honestly, is it's just what Donald\nTrump did was remain in Mexico and then pursue a complete\nrewrite of the way that we have U.S. asylum law applied\nand of asylum adjudication and really just about\nenforcing our actual laws. So when I try to explain to people is the immigration\nsystem right now is a patchwork of this deeply dishonest,\nsuch a great word, deeply dishonest system in\nwhich you use the system and set it up in such ways that illegal immigration is actually one of the easiest things to do to accomplish immigration\nto the United States. That is wrong. My parents had to apply. It wasn't easy. Do you know in India\nthere's a temple called the Visa Temple where you\nwalk 108 times around it, which is like a lucky number. And if you do it when\nyou're applying for a visa to the United States, all right, it costs a lot of money and it's hard. People get rejected all the time. There's billions of\npeople across the world who would love to be able to come here. And many of them want to do so legally, and they should have to\ngo through a process. The current way it works is it's easier to get here illegally than it is legally. I think that's fundamentally right. It's also unfair to people like us whose parents did come here legally. - Can you steer me on the\ncase against mass deportation? What are the strongest arguments? - The strongest argument would be that these people contribute to society. That these people, many\nof whom, millions of here, have been here for many\nyears, who have children, natural-born citizens because\nof birthright citizenship. It would require something that's fundamentally inhumane\nin an American, as you said, the idea of separating families, you know, across different borders simply because of what is quote unquote like \"small decision\" of\ncoming here illegally. And the best case beyond\nany of this moral stuff for no mass deportation\nis, it's good for business. Illegal immigration is\ngreat for big business. It is great for big agriculture. So if you want the lowest\nprices of all time, then yeah, mass deportation\nis a terrible idea. - But first of all, very convincing. And second of all-\n- Yeah. - I mean you can't just\ndo mass deportation without also fixing\nthe immigration system, right?\n- Yes, exactly. And I mean there are, there's several pieces\nof legislation, H.R.2, that's something that the Republicans have really coalesced around. It's a border bill. I encourage people to go read it and see some of the different fixes to the U.S. immigration system. I'm curious whether it'll\nactually pass or not. Remember, there's a very slim majority of the House of\nRepresentatives for Republicans this time around. And people vote for a lot of things when they're not in power, but when it's actually about\nto become the law, we'll see. There's a lot of swing\nstate people out there who may think twice\nbefore casting that vote. So I'm definitely curious to\nsee how that one plays out. The other thing is, is\nthat, like I just said, the biggest beneficiary of illegal immigration is big business. So if you think they're gonna\ntake this one lying down, absolutely not. They will fight for\neverything that they have to keep their pool of cheap labor because it's great for them. You know, I think JD said a story, I think he was on Rogan\nabout how he talked to a hotelier chain guy and he was just, he was like,\n\"Yeah, it's just terrible. You know, it's like they would take away our whole workforce.\" And he was like, \"Do you hear yourself? In terms of what you're talking, you're bragging about,\" but that's real. That's a real thing. And that, you know, Tyson's Foods and all these other people like, you know, that's another really sad part is, what I mean by second class\ncitizenship is this presumption first of all that Americans\nthink it's too disgusting to process meat or to work in a field. I think anybody will do anything for the right wage first of all. But second is, you know, the conditions in a lot of\nthose facilities are horrible and they're covered up for a reason. Not only in terms of the way\nthat businesses, you know, like do they actually conduct themselves, but also to cover up their\nillegal immigrant workforce. So honestly, I think it could make things\nbetter for everything. - You have studied how government works. What are the chances of\nmass deportation happens? - Well, it depends how you define it. So I mean, mass deportation\ncould lean one million. I mean, nobody even knows how many people are here illegally. It could be 20 million,\nit could be 30 million. I've seen estimates of up to\n30 million, which is crazy. That's almost 1/11 of the\nentire U.S. population. - What number do you think will\nfeel like mass deportation? One million people? - A million people is a lot. I mean, if you think about-\n- That's a lot of people. - It's a lot, I mean, but the crazy part is that's only 1/12 of what Joe Biden led to the country. So it's one of those that\njust to give people the scale of what it will all look like. Do I think mass deportation will happen? It depends on the definition. Will one million over four years? Yeah, I feel relatively confident in that. Anything over that, it's\ngonna be tough to say. Like I said, probably\nthe most efficient way to do it is to have mandatory E-Verify and to have processes in place where it becomes very difficult to live in the United States illegally. And then you'll have mass self-deportation and they will take the\nvictory lap on that. But actual, like rounding\nmillions of people up and putting them in deportation facilities and then arranging flights to God knows all across the globe, that's a logistical nightmare. It would also cost a lot of money. And don't forget, Congress\nhas to pay for all of this. So you know, we can have DOGE or we can have, you\nknow, mass deportation. So those two things are kind\nof irreconcilable actually. There's a lot of competing\ninfluences at play that people are not\nbeing real about at all. - Yeah, that was one of the\ntensions I had talking to Vivek, is he's big on mass deportation and big on making\ngovernment more efficient. And it really feels like there's a tension between those two in the short-term. - Well, yes, absolutely. Also, I mean, this is a good segue. I've been wanting to talk about this. I'm sympathetic to DOGE, to the whole Department\nof Government Efficiency. - How unreal is it that it's called DOGE. - Actually with Elon, it's quite real. I guess I've just, you\nknow, I've accepted Elon as a major political figure in the U.S., but the DOGE Committee, the Department of Government\nEfficiency is a non-statutory agency that has zero funding that Donald Trump says will advise OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. Now, two things. Number one is, as I predicted, DOGE would become a quote\nunquote \"Blue Ribbon Commission.\" So this is a non-statutory\nBlue Ribbon Commission that has been given\nauthority to Vivek Ramaswamy and to Elon Musk. Secondary, their recommendations to government should be\ncomplete by July of 2026, according to the press\nrelease released by Trump. First of all, what that will mean is\nthey're probably gonna need private funding to even set all this up. That's great, not a problem for Elon, but you're basically gonna\nbe able to have to commission GAO Reports, Government\nAccountability Office and other reports and\nfact finding missions across the government, which is fantastic. Trump can even empower you to go through to every agency\nand to collect figures. None of it matters one iota if Republican appropriators in the House of Representatives\ncare what you have to say, historically, they don't give a shit what the executive office has to say. So every year, the president\nreleases his own budget. It used to mean something, but in the last decade or so, it's become completely meaningless. The House Ways and Means Committee and the People's House\nare the ones who originate all appropriations and set up spending. So that's one is that DOGE in\nand of itself has no power, it has no ability to compel or force people to do anything. Its entire case for being, really, if you think\nabout it mechanically, is to try and convince\nand provide a report to Republican legislators\nto be able to cut spending. So that's that. Now we all know how Congress\ntakes to government reports and whether they get acted on or not. So that's number one. Number two is the figures that\nElon is throwing out there. I, again, I wanna give them some advice because people do not understand federal government spending. The absolute vast majority of government spending\nis entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, which are untouchable under Donald Trump and the most politically\npopular programs in the world. And military spending,\ndiscretionary, non-military spending, I don't have the exact\nfigure in front of me, is a very, very small part\nof the federal budget. Now, within that small slice, about 90% of that eight is bipartisan and is supported by like everybody. NOAA the, you know, the hurricane guys, like people like that. You know, people who are flying into the eye of the hurricane, people who are government\ninspectors of X, Y, and Z. The parts that are controversial that you're actually able to touch, things like welfare programs, like food stamps is an\nextraordinary small slice. So there, what's the\nnumber he put out there? 5 trillion, something like that. There is only one way to do that. And realistically,\nunder the current thing, you have to radically\nchange the entire way that the Pentagon buys everything. And I support that, but I just\nwanna be very, very clear, but I haven't seen enough\nenergy around that. There's this real belief in the U.S. that we spend billions\non all of these programs that are doing complete bullshit. But like the truth, the\nabsolute vast majority of it is military\nspending and entitlements. Trump has made clear\nentitlements are off the table, it's not gonna happen. So the way that you're\ngonna be able to cut realistically military spending over a decade long period\nis to really change the way that the United States procures, you know, procures military equipment,\nhands out government contracts. Elon actually does have\nthe background to be able to accomplish this because he\nhas had to wrangle with SpaceX and the bullshit that\nBoeing has been pulling for over a decade. But I really want everybody's expectations to be very set around this. Just remember non-statutory, Blue Ribbon. So if he's serious about it, I just laid out all of these hurdles that he's gonna have to overcome. And I'm not saying him and\nVivek aren't serious dudes, but you got to really know the system to be able to accomplish this. - So you just laid out the\nreality of how Washington works. To give the counterpoint that I think you're probably\nalso rooting for is that one as a statement like Peter Thiel said, don't bet against Elon.\n- True. - One of the things that\nyou don't usually have with Blue Ribbon is the kind\nof megaphone that Elon has. - True.\n- And I would even set the\nfinancial aspects aside, just the influence he\nhas with the megaphone, but also just with other people who are also really influential. I think that can have real power when backed by sort of\na populous movement. - I don't disagree with you, but let me give you a case\nwhere this just failed. So Elon endorsed who for\nSenate Majority Leader? Rick Scott, right? Who got the least amount\nof votes in the U.S. Senate for GOP leader? Rick Scott. John Thune is the person who got it. Now, the reason I'm bringing that up, one of my favorite books,\n\"Master of the Senate\" by Robert Caro, part of the LBJ series, the Senate has an institution,\nit reveres independence, it reveres, I mean, the\nentire theory of the Senate is to cool down the mob that is in the House of\nRepresentatives and to deliberate. That's its entire body. They are set up to be\nimmune from public pressure. Now, I'm not saying\nthey can't be pressured, but that example I just gave on Rick Scott is a very important one of. He literally endorsed somebody for leader. So did Tucker Carlson. So did a lot of people online and only 13 senators voted for Rick Scott. The truth is, is that they don't care. Like they're set up where they're marginally popular\nin their own home states, they'll be able to win their primaries and that's all they really\nneed to do to get elected. And they have six year terms,\nnot even up for four years. So will Elon still be interested in politics six years from now? That's a legitimate question\nfor a Republican senator. So maybe he could get the\nHouse of Representatives to sign off maybe on some of his things. But there's no guarantee that the Senate is going\nto agree with any of that. There's a story that Caro's tells in the \"Master of the\nSenate\" book, which I love, where Thomas Jefferson was in Paris during the writing of the Constitution. And he asked Washington, he said, \"Why did you put in a senate,\na bicameral legislature?\" And Washington said, \"Why did you pour your tea into a saucer?\" And Jefferson goes, \"To cool it.\" And Washington says, \"Just so.\" That's how to explain it. He was a man of very few words. He was a brilliant man. - Okay, so you actually\noutlined the most likely thing that's going to happen with DOGE as it hits the wall of Washington. What is the sort of the\nmost successful thing that can be pulled off? - The most successful\nthing they could do is, right now I think they're really obsessed with designing cuts, right? And identifying cuts. I would redesign systems,\nsystems of procurement. I would redesign the way that\nwe have processes in place to dispense taxpayer dollars. Because the truth is, is that\nappropriations itself, again, are set by the United States Congress. But the way that those\nappropriations are spent by the government, the executive has some\ndiscretionary authority. So your ability as the\nexecutive to be a good steward of the taxpayer money\nand to redesign a system which I actually think\nElon could be good at this and Vivek too, in terms of\ntheir entrepreneurial spirit, is the entire Pentagon procurement thing, it needs to be burned to the ground. Number one, it's bad for the Pentagon. It does, it gives them\nsubstandard equipment. It rewards very old weapon\nsystems and programs and thinking that can be\neasily defeated by people who are studying that for vulnerabilities. The perfect example is\nall of this drone warfare in Ukraine and in Russia. I mean, drone warfare\ncosts almost nothing. And yet drone swarms and\nhypersonic missiles pose huge dangers to U.S. systems, which cost hundreds of billion, of more than hundreds\nof billions of dollars. So my point is that\ngiving nimble procurement and systemic change in the way that we think about executing the mission that Congress does give you actually could save the\nmost amount of money in the long run. That's where I would really focus in on. The other one is, you know, counter to\neverything I just said is maybe they would listen. You know, maybe the Republicans are like, \"yeah, okay, let's do it.\" The problem again though\nis swing state people who need to get reelected,\nthey need to do one thing, they need to deliver for their district. They need to run on stuff. And nobody has ever run on\ncutting money for your state. They have run on bringing\nmoney to your state. And that's why earmarks and a lot of these other things\nare extraordinarily popular in Congress is because\nit's such an easy way to show constituents how\nyou're working for them whenever it does come reelection time. So it's a very difficult system and I also wanna tell people\nwho are frustrated by this, I share your frustration, but the system is\ndesigned to work this way. And for two centuries the\nSenate has stood as a bulwark against literally every popular change. And because of that, it's\ndesigned to make sure that it's so popular for long enough that it has to become inevitable before the status quo can change. That's really, really frustrating. But you should take comfort in that it's always been that way. So it's been okay. - Well, as I've learned from one of the recommendations\nof \"The Age of Acrimony,\" is I feel embarrassed that I didn't know that senators used to not be elected. - What a crazy system, huh? - Yeah, I mean many of the\nthings we take for granted now as defining our democracy\nwas kind of invented, developed after the Civil War. - Right.\n- In the sort of 50 years after the Civil War. - Absolutely correct. - \"Age of Acrimony.\" Oh\nmy god, I love that book. I cannot recommend it\nenough, it is so important. And one of the biggest mistakes that Americans make is\nthat we study periods where greatness happened, but we don't often study\nperiods where nothing happened or where really bad shit happened. - Yeah.\n- You know, we don't spend nearly enough. Americans know about FDR, they don't really know\nanything about the depression or how we got there. What was it like to be\nalive in the United States in 1840, right? Nobody thinks about that really, 'cause it's kind of an\nin-between time in history. There are people who\nlived their entire lives, who were born, who had to\nlive through those times, who were just as\nconscientious and intelligent as you and I are, and we're\njust trying to figure shit out and things felt really big. So \"The Age of Acrimony\" is a time where it's almost completely ignored outside of the Gilded Age aspect. But like you just said, it was a time where progressive\nreform of government and of the tension between civil rights, extraordinary wealth and democracy and really the reigning\nin of big business, so many of our foundations\nhappened exactly in that time. And I take a lot of comfort from that book because one of the things I\nlearned from the book is that voter participation is highest when people are pissed off, not when they're happy.\n- Yeah. - And that's such a\ncounterintuitive thing. But voter participation goes down when the system is working. So 2020, right. I think we can all agree\nit was very tense election. That's also why it had the\nhighest voter participation ever. 2024, very high rates of\nparticipation, same thing. People are pissed off and that's actually what\ndrives them to the vote. But something that I take\ncomfort in that is that people being pissed off and\npeople going out to vote, it actually does have\nmajor impact on the system because otherwise, the\nstatus quo is basically allowed to continue. And so, yeah, like you just said, I mean, direct election\nof senators wasn't, I mean, there are probably\npeople alive today who are like, who were born when there was\nno direct election of senators. Which is an insane thing to think about. I mean, it'd be almost a hundred or so. But the point is, is that at that time it was so deeply corrupt and it was one where the quasi aristocracy from the early days leading\ninto the Gilded Age were able to enforce their will upon the people, but you can take comfort in that, that was one of those areas where Americans were so fed up with it, they changed the constitution and actually forced the\naristocrats in power to give their own power. - Yeah.\n- It's like our version of when they flipped power and took away the legislative power of the House of Lords in the UK. I just think that's amazing. And it's such a cool thing about\nour country and the UK too. - It's the continued battle between the people and the elite. Right, and we should mention not just the direct election of senators, but the election of\ncandidates for a party. - Yes.\n- That was also invented. It used to be that the quote\nunquote \"party bosses,\" I say that with a half a\nchuckle, chose the candidate. - Yeah, the whole system is nuts. The way that we currently\nexperience politics is such a modern invention. - With a little asterisk with Kamala Harris, but you know.\n- Right. Yeah, good point. - But, well, that was actually more of a mean reversion, right?\n- Yeah. - We're living in an\nextraordinarily new era where we actually have\nmore input than ever on who our candidates are. It used to be, this is crazy. So the conventions have always taken place two months before, right? Imagine a world where you did not know who the pre-nominee was gonna\nbe before that convention. And the nominee literally was\ndecided at that convention by those party bosses. Even crazier, there used to be a standard in American politics where presidents did\nnot directly campaign. They in fact did not even\ncomment about the news or mention their opponent's names. They would give speeches\nfrom their doorstep, but it was unseemly for them to engage in direct politics. - You would not get a Bernie Sanders. - No, no.\n- You would not get a Donald Trump, - Obama, Bill Clinton, I mean, basically every president from John F. Kennedy\nonwards has been a product of the new system. Every president prior to\nthat has been much more of the older system. There was a in-between period post FDR where things were really changing. But the primary system\nitself had its first true big win under John F. Kennedy. - I think that the lesson from that is there's a collective wisdom\nto the people, right? - I think so. - I think it works. - Yeah. I mean, well,\nokay, I'll steel man it. We had some great presidents\nin the party boss era. FDR was a great president. FDR was the master of coalitional\npolitics of his ability. In fact, what really made\nhim a genius was his ability to get this overthrow the support of a lot of the corruption and the elite democrats to take part, to take control in\nthere at the convention. And then combine his personal popularity to fuse all systems of power. Where he had the elites\nbasically under his boot 'cause he was the king and\nhe used his popular power and his support from the people to be able to enforce things up and down. I mean, you know, even\nin the party boss era, we would have no, a lot of the people we revere\nreally came out of that, people like Abraham Lincoln. I mean, I don't think Abraham\nLincoln would have won a party primary in 1860. There's no chance he won. He won, luck, thank God, from an insane process in the\n1860 Republican Convention. People should go read about\nthat because that was wild. I think we were this close\nto not having Lincoln as president and yeah, I mean, Teddy Roosevelt. There's so many that I could point to who made great impacts on history. So the system does find a way\nto still produce good stuff. - That was a kind of beautiful diversion from the DOGE discussion. If you're gonna return briefly to DOGE.\n- Sure. - So we kind of talked about cost cutting, but there's also increasing\nthe efficiency of government. - Yes.\n- Which you also kind of talked about procurement.\n- Yeah- - So, and maybe we can throw into the pile the 400 plus federal agencies. So let's take another perspective on what success might look like. So like radically successful DOGE, would it basically cut a\nlot of federal agencies? - Probably combine. - Combine?\n- Okay, so I can give great examples of this\n'cause I have great insight. Like for each agency, we'll often use different\nlike payroll systems. They'll have different\ninternal processes, right? That makes no sense. And it's all because it's antiquated. Now, everybody always\ntalks about changing it, but there are a lot of\nlike party interests about why certain people\nget certain things. The real problem with government, the people like us who are\nprivate and like for example, when you wanna do something,\nyou can just do it. So I was listening to a\nreally interesting analysis about law enforcement and the military. So I think the story was that\nthe military was assigned, National Guard guys were\nassigned to like help with the border and they\nwere trying to provide, I think it was translation services to people at border patrol. But somebody had to come down and be like, \"Hey, this has got to stop, according to U.S. code X, Y, and Z, the United States Military\ncannot help with law enforcement, you know, abilities here.\" And so even though that\nmakes absolutely no sense, because there all work, there\nare literal legal statutes in place that prevent you from doing the most efficient thing possible. So for some reason we have to\nhave a ton of Spanish speakers in SOUTHCOM, you know, in the U.S. Command that is responsible for South America, who literally cannot help\nwith a crisis at the border. Now maybe you can find\nsome legal chicanery to make that work, but man, you got to have an attorney general who knows what he's doing, you need a White House counsel, you need to make sure that shit\nstands up in a court of law. I mean, it's not so simple. Whereas let's say, you know,\nyou have a software right here and you wanna get a new\nsoftware, you can just do it. You can hire whoever you want. When you're the government,\nthere's a whole process you got to go through about bidding and it just takes forever\nand it is so inefficient. But unfortunately, the\ninefficiency is really derivative of a lot of legal statutes. And that is something that, yeah, again, actually, you know, radically successful\n\"DOGE,\" quote unquote, would be study the law and\nthen change it, you know, like, figure, instead of cost cutting, like cut this program or whatever, like I just said about why do\ndifferent systems use payroll? Just say that you can change the statute under which new software can be updated, let's say after 90 days. You know, I've heard\nstories of people who work for the government who still\nhave like IBM mainframe, that they're still, in 2024,\nthat they're still working 'cause those systems\nhave never been updated. There's also a big problem with a lot of this clearance stuff. That's where a lot of inefficiency happens because a lot of contractors\ncan only work based upon previous clearance that they already got. Achieving a clearance is very expensive. It's very lengthy process. I'm not saying it shouldn't be, talking about security clearance, but it does naturally, you know, create a very small pool that you can draw some contracts from. And I even mean stuff like, like the janitor at the Pentagon needs a security service, right? So clearance, so there's only\nlike five people who are, or can even apply for that contract. Well, naturally, in an\ninterim monopoly like that, he's gonna jack his price up because he literally has\na moat around his product. Whereas if you or I are\nhiring a gen, whatever, anybody for anything, that type of credentialism\nand legal regime, it doesn't matter at all. So there are million problems like this that people in government run into, and that is what I would\nsay as the most successful. - You know, paperwork\nslows everything down and it feels impossible\nto break through that in a sort of incremental way. - It's so hard.\n- It feels like the only way to do it is literally shut down agencies in\nsome kind of radical way and then build up from scratch. Of course, as you highlight,\nthat's going to be opposed by a lot of people within government. - Yeah, well, historically\nthere's only one way to do it and it's a really bad answer, war, war, that's the-\n- Yeah. So I was gonna say, basically, you have the\nkind of consensus where, okay, all this stupid\nbureaucratic bullshit we've been doing, we need to like put that shit aside. Get the fuck out of here,\nwe need to win a war. So like all the paperwork.\n- That's it, yeah.\n- You know, all the lawyers go leave, please. - Yeah, exactly. No, but I want people to\nreally understand that, you know, up until 1865 or\n1860, I forget the exact year, we didn't even have national currency. And then we were like,\nwell, we need a greenback. And prior to that, people would freak out if we were talking about\nhaving national currency greenback backed by the, you know, the U.S. government and all that. Not even a question\npassed in like two weeks in the U.S. Congress. An income tax eventually went away, but not even in the realm of possibility and they decide to pass it. Same thing after World War I and you think about how World War II, I mean, World War II just\nfundamentally changed the entire way the United\nStates government works. Even the DHS, which I mentioned earlier, the Department of Homeland Security, it didn't even exist prior to 9/11. It was done as response\nto 9/11 to coalesce all of those agencies under\none branch to make sure that nothing like that\ncould ever happen again. And so historically, unfortunately, absolute shit show disaster\nwar is the only thing that moves and throws the\npaperwork off the table. And I wish I wasn't such\na downer, but I've just, I've both, I've read too much and I've had enough\nexperience now in Washington to just see how these dreams\nget crushed instantly. And I wish it wasn't that way. I mean, it's a cool idea and I want people who are inspired, who are getting into politics to think that they can do something, but I want them to be realistic too. And I want them to know\nwhat they're signing up for whenever they do something like that. And the titanic amount of\nwork it's going to take for you to be able to\naccomplish something. - Yeah, but I've also\nheard a lot of people in Silicon Valley laughing\nwhen Elon rolled in and fired 90% of Twitter. Here's this guy, Elon Musk, that- - You are absolutely correct.\n- Knows nothing about running a social media company. Of course, you need all these servers, of course, you need all these employees. - Right.\n- And nevertheless, the service keeps running. - He figured it out and\nyou have to give him eternal credit for that. I guess the difference is no, there was no law that he could fire him. You know, there was no, like at the end of the,\nhe owned the company. You know, he had total discretion\nof his ability to move. So I'm not even saying his ideas are bad. I'm saying that the ability that's, what makes him such an incredible\nvisionary entrepreneur? Its movement, its deference\nat times to the right people, but also, the knowledge\nof every individual piece of the machine and his ability to come in and to execute his full vision at any time and override any of the managers. So I talked previously about the professional managerial class and the managerial revolution. Elon is one of the few\npeople who's ever built a multi-billion dollar company who has not actually fallen victim to the managerial revolution\nand against entrepreneurship and innovation that happens there. There are very few people who\ncan do it, Elon, Steve Jobs. But you know, what do we\nlearn is that unfortunately after Steve died, Apple\nbasically needs succumb to the managerial revolution and has become like the product, you know, they make all their money\nby printing services and making it impossible\nto leave this ecosystem as opposed to building the\nmost cool product ever. As much as I love my Vision\nPro, don't get me wrong. - I think you just admitted\nthat you're part of a cult. - I know, I literally am. - Yeah.\n- I am. I'm fully admit it. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. I miss Steve. - Grass is greener on the other side. Come join us. Okay. Whether it's Elon or somebody else, what gives you hope about something like a radical transformation of\ngovernment towards efficiency, towards being more slim? What gives you hope that\nthat would be possible? - Well, I wouldn't put it that way. I don't think slimness in and\nof itself is a good thing. What I care about is the\nrelationship to people at its government. So the biggest problem\nthat we have is that we have a complete loss of faith\nin all of our institutions. And I really encourage people, I don't think people can quite understand what the relationship between America and its government was\nlike after World War II and after FDR, like 90% of the people\ntrusted the government. That's crazy. Like when the president said something, they were like, okay, he's not lying. Think about our cynical attitude\ntowards politicians today. That is largely the fault of Lyndon Johnson and of Richard Nixon. And that entire fallout period of Vietnam. Vietnam in particular really\nbroke the American character and its ability and its\nrelationship with government. And we've never recovered faith in institutions ever since that. And it's really unfortunate. So what makes me hopeful, at least this time is\nanytime a president wins a popular vote and an election\nis they have the ability to reset and to actually\ntry and build something that is new. And so what I would hope\nis that this is different from the first Trump\nadministration in which the mandate for Donald Trump is actually\ncarried out competently. Yes, he can do his antics,\nwhich got him elected. You know, at this point we can't deny it. McDonald's thing is hilarious,\nit's funny, well, it is. People love it. People like the podcasting. People like-\n- Garbage truck. - The garbage truck. Yeah, exactly. They like the stunts\nand he will always excel and he will continue to do that. There are policy and other\nthings that he can and should do like the pursuit of no war, like solving the immigration question and also, really figuring out our economy the way that it currently\nruns and changing it so that the actual American\ndream is more achievable. And housing is one of the chief problems that we have right now. The real thing is Donald Trump was elected on the backs of the working man. I mean, it's just true. Households under $100,000\nvoted for Donald Trump. Maybe they didn't do so\nfor economic reasons. I think a lot of them did for economic, a lot of them did for\nimmigration, for cultural, but you still owe them something. And there is a, I would hope that they\ncould carry something out in that respect that is\nnot a similar continuation and chaotic vibe of the first time where everything felt\nlike it exploded any time with staffing, with even his\npolicy or what he cared about or his ability to pursue. And a lot of that does\ncome back to personnel. So I'm concerned in some respects, I'm like, you know, not\nthrilled in some respects I'm happy in some respects, but it remains to be seen\nhow he's gonna do it. - To the degree it's\npossible to see Trumpism and MAGA as a coherent ideology. What do you think are the\ncentral pillars of it? - MAGA is a rejection of cultural elitism. That's what I would say. Cultural elitism though has\nmany different categories. Immigration is one, right, is that cultural elitism and cultural liberalism\nhas a fundamental belief that immigration in and of\nitself is a natural good at any and all levels. That all immigrants are\nlike replacement level, that there is no difference between them. Cultural elitism in a foreign\npolicy context comes back to a lot of that human\nrights democracy stuff that I was talking about earlier, which divorces American values from American interests and says that actually American values\nare American interests. Cultural elitism and\nliberalism leads to the worship of the postal rights era of bureaucracy that I talked about from those two books of DEI of quote unquote \"woke\" and of progressive social ideology. So I would put all those together as ultimately what MAGA is. It is a screw you. I once drove past, it was in rural Nevada, and I was driving and I drove past the biggest sign I've ever seen, political sign to this day. And it's just, it was in 2020 and just said, \"Trump,\nfuck your feelings.\" And I still believe that is the most coherent\nMAGA thing I've ever seen. Because everyone's always like, how can a neocon and Tulsi Gabbard and RFK and all these other people, how can they all exist\nunder the same umbrella? And I'm like, it's very simple. All of them have rejected\nthe cultural elite in their own way certainly, but they've arrived at the same place. It's an umbrella and it's an umbrella fundamentally, which has nothing to\ndo with the status quo and with the, you know, currently established cultural elite, that doesn't mean they're not elite and they're not rich in their own regards, that doesn't mean they don't disagree, but that's the one thing\nthat unites the entire party. And so that's the way I would put it. - Anti-cultural elite. Is that synonymous with\nanti-establishment? So basic distrust of all institutions. Is elitism connected to institutions? - Yes, absolutely. Because elites are the ones\nwho runs our institutions. That said anti-establishment\nis really not the right word because there are a lot of left-wingers who are anti-establishment, right? They are against that, but they're not anti-cultural leftism. And that's the key\ndistinction between MAGA and like left populism. Left populism basically does agree. They agree with like basic conceits, like racism is one of the\nbiggest problem facing America. They're like, one of the ways that we would fix that\nis through class-oriented economic programs in\norder to address that. But we believe in, I don't know, like reparations as a concept. It's just more about how we arrive there. Whereas in MAGA we would say no, we actually don't think that at all. We think we've evolved past that and we think that the\nbest way to fix it is, actually similar policy prescription. But the mindset matters a lot. So the real distinction between MAGA and like left populism\nreally is on culture. Trans in particular, orientation about, actually immigration\nmay be the biggest one because if you look at the\nhistory of Bernie Sanders, you know, Bernie Sanders was a person who railed against open borders and against mass migration for years. There are famous interviews\nof him on YouTube with Lou Dobbs, who's one of\nthe hardcore immigration guys, and they agree with each other. And Lou is like, \"Bernie's one\nof the only guys out there,\" Bernie, at the end of the day, he had to succumb to the cultural left. And its changing attitudes\non mass immigration. There's some famous clips\nfrom 2015 in a Vox interview that he gave where he started, I think he started talking about how the open borders is a Koch brothers libertarian concept, right? Because Bernie is a basically of a European welfare state tradition. European welfare states\nare very simply understood. We have high taxes, high\nservices, low rates of immigration because we have high\ntaxes and high services, we have a limited pool of people who can experience and\ntake those services. He used to understand that. He changed a lot of his attitude. Bernie also, I will say,\nlook, he's a courageous man and a courageous politician. You know, as late as 2017, he actually endorsed a pro-life candidate because he said that that\npro-life candidate was, you know, pro-worker. And he's like, \"At the end of the day, I care about pro-worker policy.\" He took a ton of shit for it and I don't think he's done it since. So the sad part that's\nreally happened is that a lot of left populist, you know, agenda, and other has become subsumed, you know, in the hysteria around\ncultural leftism wokeism, whatever the hell you wanna call it. And that ultimately that\ncultural leftism was the thing that really united, you know,\nthe two wings of that party. And that's really why MAGA\nis very opposed to that. They're really not the same, but the left populist can\nstill be anti-establishment. That's the key. - It's interesting to think of the left cultural elite subsuming\nconsuming Bernie Sanders, the left populist. So you think that's what happened? - That's what I would say. - What do you think happened\nin 2016 with Bernie? Is there a possible future\nwhere he would've won? You and Krystal wrote a\nbook on populism in 2020. So from that perspective,\njust looking at 2016, if he rejected wokeism at that time, by the way, that would be\npretty gangster June 2016. Would he have, because I think Hillary went\ntowards the left more, right? Am I remembering that correctly? - It was a very weird time. So yes and no, it wasn't full on BLM\nmania like it was in 2020, but the signs were all there. So the Great Awokening was in 2014. I know it's a ridiculous term. I'm sorry.\n- I love it. Please keep saying it.\n- But- - There's a ring to it.\n- Well, just to give the origin, the Great Awakening is about the great religious revival\nin the United States. So people had, you know,\nbecause wokeism is a religion, you know, that's a common refrain. They were like, the Great\nAwokening is a really good term so. - Thank you for explaining the joke. Yep.\n- Yeah. So the Great Awokening is\nbasically when racial attitudes amongst college educated whites basically flipped on its head. There are a variety of\nreasons why this happened. I really believe that\nTa-Nehisi Coates's case for reparations in the\nAtlantic is one of those, it radicalized an entire generation of basically like white\ncollege educated women to think completely differently on race. It was during Ferguson, and then it also happened immediately after the Trayvon Martin case. Those two things really set the stage for the eventual BLM takeover of 2020. But fundamentally what\nthey did is they changed racial attitudes amongst\ncollege educated elites to really think in a race first construct. And worse is that they\nwere rejected in 2016 at the ballot box by the\nelection of Donald Trump. And in response, they ramped it up because they believed that\nthat was the framework to view the world. That people voted for\nTrump because he was racist and not for a variety of other reasons that they eventually did. And so the point around this on question of whether Bernie could have\nwon in 2016, I don't know, Krystal seems to think so, I'm skeptical. I'm skeptical for a variety of reasons. I think the culture is\nhonestly one of them. One of Trump's core issues\nin 2016 was immigration. And Bernie and him did\nnot agree on immigration. And if immigration, you know,\neven if people did, you know, support Bernie Sanders and his vision for working class people like the debates and the understanding about\nwhat it would look like, like a healthcare system\nwhich literally would pay for illegal immigrants, I think he would've gotten killed on that. But I could be wrong, I honestly, I will never know, you\nknow what that looked like. - Let me reference you from earlier in the conversation with FDR. It's not the policy. I think if he went more anti-establishment and more populist as\nopposed to trying to court, trying to be friendly with the DNC. - Yeah, I mean, that's\na good counterfactual. Nobody will really know. Look, I have a lot of love\nfor the Bernie 2016 campaign. He has a great ad from\n2016 called \"America.\" You should watch it, it's a great ad. That's another very interesting thing. It's unapologetically patriotic and that is not something that you see in a lot of left-wing circles these days. So he understood politics at a base level that a lot of people did not. But you know, Bernie himself, and then a lot of the Bernie\nmovement was basically crushed by the elite Democratic Party\nfor a variety of reasons. They hated them. You know, they basically, they attacked Joe Rogan\nfor even having him on and for giving him a\nplatform that was ridiculous. Obviously, it backfired their\nface, which is really funny. There is, but there were\na lot of million examples like that, you know,\nwhen they attacked Bernie for endorsing a pro-life politician, he never did it again. They attacked Bernie for run, for having Bernie bros, you know, people online, the\nbros who were Super Bro Bernie. And it was his fault. His supporters would say nasty\nthings about Elizabeth Warren and he would like defend straight himself and be like, \"Yes, I'm sorry,\nyou know, please my bro.\" He was like, \"stop that.\" - I think that his biggest\nproblem is he never went full Trump, like he didn't go, like he kept saying sorry. - Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. It, actually, in 2020, I did a ton of analysis\non this at the time. He would always do stuff\nlike, \"Joe Biden, my friend.\" And it's like, no, he's not your friend. He stands for everything that you disagree with.\n- Yeah. - Everything. He'd be like, \"Yeah, he's a nice guy, but he's not my friend.\" But he would always be like,\n\"Joe and I are great friends, but you know, we have a\nsmall disagreement on this,\" but you know, like you just said, in terms of going full Trump, they wanted to see Trump\nup there humiliating all of the GOP politicians that they didn't trust anymore. That's what people really wanted. But the other side of this\nis that the Democratic base in 2020 was very different than 2016 because by 2020 they full on had TDS and they were basically like, we need to defeat Trump at all costs. We don't give a shit what your name is, Bernie, Biden, whatever, whichever of you is\ngonna best defeat Trump, you get the knob. 2016 is different because they didn't full on have that like love and necessity of winning. By the way, this is a strategic advantage that the Democrats have. Democrats just care about winning, the current base of the party. All they wanna do is win. Republican base, they don't\ngive a shit about winning. They just love Trump. So it's nice to win. But one of those where\nthey will express their id for what they really want. Now it's worked out for\nthem because it turns out that's a very palpable political force. But one of the reasons why, you know, you won't see me up here\ndoing James Carville, \"40 More Years,\" is there is a law of something called thermostatic public opinion, where, you know, the thermostat, it changes a lot whenever you actually, so when you have a left-wing\npresident in power, the country goes right. When you have a right-wing\npresident in power, the country goes left. Amazing, right? You can actually look at a graph of economic attitudes from the two months where Joe Biden became\npresident after Donald Trump. So Republicans, Trump was president of the last year in\noffice, economy's great, two months later, the economy is horrible. That is a perfect example\nof thermostatic opinion. And I'm not counting these Democrats out. 2004, George W. Bush\nwins the popular vote. He has a historic mandate\nto continue in Iraq by '06, he's toasted. We have a massive midterm election, and by '08, we're writing\nbooks about 40 more years and how there's never gonna be Republican in office ever again. So things can change a lot in\na very short period of time. - I think also for me\npersonally, maybe I'm deluded, sort of the great man view of history. I think some of it, it's\nin programming circles, the term skills issue. I think some of it just\nhas to do how good you are, how charismatic you are, how\ngood you are as a politician. I, maybe, you disagree with this. I'd love to see what you think. I think if Obama, if you were\nallowed to run for many terms, I think Obama would just keep winning. He would win 2016, he would win 2020, he would win this year, 2024. - It's possible, but\nI would flip it on you and I would say Obama\nwould never be elected if there were no term limits because Bill Clinton would've\nstill been president. - Right.\n- Yeah. - So, well those two, right?\n- Yeah. Yeah. - Those two examples of exactly, they, extremely skilled politicians and somehow can appear like populists. - Man, Bill Clinton was\na force in his time. And it's honestly sad\nwhat's happened to him. I was actually just talking\nwith a friend the other day. I'm like, I kind of don't think that presidents should become\npresident when they're young because they live to see\nthemselves become irrelevant. And that must be really painful. - Yeah.\n- Because I know what it takes to get there. Imagine being Clinton, I mean, your entire legacy was destroyed with Hillary Clinton in 2016. And then imagine being Obama, who in 2016, you could argue it's a one-off and say that Trump is just, oh,\nHillary was a bad candidate, but Michelle and Barack Obama\nwent so hard for Kamala Harris and they just got blown\nout in the popular vote. I mean, the Obama era officially ended with Donald Trump's reelection\nto the presidency in 2024. And that was a 20-year period where Obama was one of the\nmost popular central figures in American politics. But I wanna return to what you're saying because it is important, and by the way, I do not support term limits\non American presidents. - Are you a fascist? - Well, that would imply, that would imply that I\ndon't believe in democracy. I actually do believe in democracy because I think the people,\nif they love their president, should be able to reelect him. I think FDR was amazing. I think that the term limit change was a, basically what happened is, is that Republicans and\na lot of elite Democrats always wanted to speak\nagainst FDR, but he was a God. So they couldn't, so they\nwaited until he died, and then after he died,\nthey were like, yeah, this whole third, fourth term,\nthat can never happen again. And America didn't really\nthink that hard about it, but they were like, yeah, okay, whatever. But I mean, it had immense consequences for American history. Clinton is the perfect example. I mean, just- Bill Clinton left office, even despite the Lewinsky bullshit, he had a 60% approval rating. Okay, no way George W. Bush\ngets elected, impossible. Clinton would've blown his ass out. And imagine the consequences of that. We would've no Iraq. I mean, I'm not saying he was a great man, like we probably still would've\nhad the financial crisis and there's still a lot of bad\nstuff that would've happened. But he was a popular dude. And you know, I wouldn't say he had the\nbest judgment at times, presidentially, not personally,\ndefinitely not personally, but you know, presidentially. But I'm pretty confident\nwe would've not gone into the Iraq war. And so that's where it really cost us. If you're left-wing and you're\ntalking about Obama, yeah, I think Obama probably\nwould've won in 2016, although it's a counterfactual. Because Obama was never\nchallenged in the same way that MAGA was able to, to the liberal consensus. Like Romney really ran this\nlike awful campaign, honestly, about cutting spending. It was very traditional Republican. It was deeply unpopular. The autopsy of that election was, we actually need to be\nmore pro-immigration. That literally was the autopsy. But Trump understood the assignment. There are two people\nwho I so deeply respect for their political bets,\nPeter Thiel and Donald Trump. So one of the books that\nI recommended called \"The Unwinding\" by George Packer, he actually talks about Peter Thiel there, this is in 2013. And Thiel talks about, he was like, \"You know, whoever runs for office next, they don't need to run\non an optimistic message. They need to run on a message that everything is fucked\nup and that we need to fix.\" And if you think about,\nthat's why Thiel's endorsement of Trump with the American\ncarnage message is, I mean it took, it was\nshocking, right, at the time. But he had that fundamental insight that that's what the\nAmerican people wanted. Trump too comes out of an election in 2012 where the literal GOP autopsy, the report produced by the party says, we need to be pro mass immigration. What happens? Immediately after 2012, they\nstart to go for mass immigrant, basically they go for\nlike these amnesty plans, the so-called Gang of\nEight plan, Marco Rubio, and all of this in 2013, it falls apart, but Republicans get punished\nby their base in 2014. So Eric Cantor, who was\nthe House majority leader, the number two Republican, spent more on stake in his campaign than his primary opponent who\nsuccessfully defeated him, a guy named Dave Brat. Dave Brat kicked his ass\non the issue of immigration and said that Eric Cantor, is pro-amnesty. All of the forces were there. And then in 2015, Trump\ncomes down the escalator and he gives the message on immigration that the GOP base has been\nroaring and wanting to hear now, but that nobody wanted to listen to them. And that was his fundamental insight. That bet was a colossal and a Titanic political bet at a time when all political ideology and thought process would've said that you should come\nout on the other side, which is where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and all these other guys\nwere effectively there, you know, in varying different ways like they were hawkish or whatever. But Trump was just so, had such a monopoly on that as an idea. That's why he wins in 2016 primary. And then paired with immigration, a hard line position on immigration, is this American carnage idea that actually everything is wrong. The American dream has gone. You know, we will stop\nthis American carnage. And I think American carnage is one of the most important\ninaugural speeches ever given in American history. Put it up against every\nsingle other speech. There's nothing else like it. But that was what the\ncountry wanted at the time. And that's what great\npoliticians are able to do, is they're able to suss something out. That's also why Peter Thiel is who he is, because he saw that in 2000. Imagine, you know, what\nit takes to come out of the 2012 election to be, and to be honestly totally contrarian to the entire national mood and this entire theory of\nObama-esque star politics and say, no, you need somebody who runs on the opposite of that to win. - Well, we'll never know. And I love this kind of Mike\nTyson versus Muhammad Ali. I still think I would've loved\nto see Obama versus Trump. - Me too. I agree. - And first of all, Obama\nversus Trump in 2008, Obama wins hands down. - Well, yes, definitely. - So this is, I love how\nthis is a boxing talk. - Yeah.\n- Now when 2016, Obama has a bunch of, you know, Iraq and Afghanistan. - He's vulnerable though,\nI'll tell you why. DACA, that's what nobody ever talks about in the Obama Trump thing. Don't forget Obama takes his 2012 victory. Basically says, \"Oh,\nthe GOP even now agrees with me on immigration.\" And then he does DACA and he legalizes, you know, X million in a number of illegal immigrants who are here, who are brought here as children. That also fundamentally changed the immigration consensus\non the Republican side, 'cause they were like, \"Wait, holy shit, you can just do that? because we don't agree with that at all.\" And that really ignited the base as well. So I'm not sure, I mean, a\nmoment I think about a lot with Trump and just like\nbeing able to unleash the rage of the Republican bases,\nin the 2012 debate, Candy Crowley was the\nmoderator with Mitt Romney And she fact-check him famously. This was when fact checking\nwas shocking in a present. And she said something about Benghazi and she was like, \"No, he did say that,\" she like corrected\nRomney on behalf of Obama to this day it's questionable\nwhether she was even right. But, and Romney was just\nlike, \"Oh, he did? Okay.\" Trump would've been like,\n\"Excuse me, excuse me.\" Be like, \"Look at this woman.\" And you know, he would've gone off. And I was like, and I\nthink about that moment because that's what the\nRepublican base wanted to hear. But also, it turns out America had a lot of festering feelings\nabout the mainstream media that it needed unleashed. And Trump was just this incredible vector to just blow up this system. Which, I mean, if you\nask me about optimism, that's the thing I'm most optimism about.\n- Yeah. Don't you think Obama had a good sense in how to turn it on? How to be anti-establishment correctly? - I will not deny that he's one of the most\ntalented politicians, literally, to ever play the game. And he is, I mean, just\nunbelievable rhetorical talent. Look, as a counterfactual, would he be in more talented than Hillary? Yeah. Okay. No question. In terms of anybody\nwould've been for that one. But at the same time,\nall the signs were there. All the signs for the Trump victory and for the backlash against Obama-ism kind of as a political project. It all existed. You know, the tea, if you like, I just laid\nthe tea leaves out there from 2012 to 2015, in retrospect, it's the most\npredictable thing in the world that Donald Trump will get elected. But it was crazy in the moment, I got to live through that, which was really fun, like professionally. - I think it's unfortunate that he kind of let Kamala Harris borrow his reputation. - Oh it's, I mean it's\nlike, you know better, dude. You know. You defeated these people. - Yeah.\n- The Clinton machine, you destroyed them and it was awesome in '08. - What is that? Why do you, why did he, like, he's so much bigger\nand better than the machine. - I don't get it.\n- It's interesting, right? - Yeah. It's so weird though. I just think-\n- I think this was a wake up call, 2024 was a wake up call. Like the DNC machine doesn't work. - Absolutely, I mean-\n- There needs to be new blood, new candidate,\nnew Obama-like candidates. - Well, I'm glad you brought that up. 'Cause that's important too,\nin terms of the process, and the way that things currently stand. The DNC actually rigged\nits entire primary system under Biden way to the, not to the benefit of Obama. So for example, you\nknow how they moved away from the Iowa caucuses and they actually moved\nsome other primaries and moved the calendar to\nreward traditional states that vote much more in line with the Democratic establishment. So the story of Barack\nObama is one that not many, actually, probably a lot\nof young people today don't even remember how it happened. In 2008, Obama was the underdog, right? And actually, here's the critical thing, Obama was losing with Black people. Why? Black Democrats simply did not believe that white people would\nvote for a Black guy. So Barack Obama goes to\nthis white state, Iowa, all in on the Iowa caucuses and shocks the world by\nwinning the Iowa caucuses. Overnight, there is a\nshift in public opinion amongst the Black population\nin South Carolina that says, \"Oh, shit, he actually could win.\" And he comes out and\nhe wins South Carolina. And that's basically\nwas near the death now for the Hillary Clinton campaign. The problem is by moving South Carolina up and by making it first along with other more\npro-establishment friendly places, what do we do? We make it so that Barack\nObama could never happen again. We make it so that an older, you know, base of Democratic Party voters who listens to the elites can never have their\nassumptions challenged. And that's one of the\nworst things Joe Biden did. You know, I talked about his arrogance. He was so arrogant, he changed the freaking primary system. He was so arrogant, he\nrefused to do a debate. I mean, imagine history. How lucky are we, honestly, that Joe Biden agreed to do that debate with Donald Trump early. And again, that was his arrogance. I think we're so lucky for it because if we hadn't gotten, we got to understand as a\ncountry how cooked he was and how fake everything was behind the scenes in\nfront of all of our eyes. And they tried for three straight years to make sure that that would never happen. So, I mean, it's still\nsuch a crime, honestly, against the American people. - I've been thinking about\nwho I want to talk to for three hours and that's\nwhy I bring up Obama 'cause he's probably the\nnumber one person on the left. I would like to hear, analyze\nwhat happened in this election and what happened to the\nUnited States of America over the past 20 plus years. I can't imagine anybody else. - Look, if anybody could\ndo it, it'd be you. But there are layers upon\nlayers with that man. I would love to actually sit\nwith talk with him for real. - I think it's fair to say that we talked about the\ngreat man view of history. I think you have a\npsychopath view of history where all great leaders\nare for sure psychopaths. - Not for sure. There are many who are good\npeople, Harry Truman was- - You're like some of my best friends.\n- Yeah. Some-\n- Harry Truman. Harry Truman, okay.\n- I assume are good people. To be fair though,\n(Lex laughing) most of the good ones are\naccidents like Harry Truman. He never would've gotten himself elected. He was a great dude. - How do you know he's a great dude? - David McCullough book, I highly recommended\neverybody should read it. Truman loved his wife. I think that's really awesome. I love when politicians love their wife. It's so rare. He adored his wife, he adored his daughter,\nspent time with them. He made family life a priority. He had really good small town judgment that he would apply to foreign affairs. He was just a very well\nconsidered, very standup man. And I so appreciate that about him. Another one is John Adams. I love and revere John Adams. He's my favorite Founding Father. Him and John Quincy, they don't get nearly enough of their due. They were some of the most\nintelligent, well-considered, they were family men that he, you know, the love, the relationship between John and Abigail Adams\nis literally legendary. And I think it's amazing, you know, especially in the context of the 1700s, the way that he would take her counsel and into conversations\nand her own ability. And she would sit there and go toe to toe as much with Thomas Jefferson. There are some who are great, who are really, really good presidents, who have good judgment and who are really good people and really think deeply about the world and have really cool personal lives. But there's also the\nvast majority of them, especially in the, I would say, especially in the modern era and where the price of\nthe presidency extracts everything that you have. You have to be able to, you have to be willing to\ngive everything and it's just, that's not a price that\nmost people wanna pay. - Is it possible that some of the people who you think are sociopaths\nin politics are in fact really good people? And some of the people you\nthink are good, like Truman- - Yeah,\n- And Adams are actually sociopaths? - Definitely, I mean,\nI could just be reading the wrong books, right? - Yeah, that's right.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- It sounds like you're- - Yeah.\n- You just read some really compelling biographies. - Well, okay, to be fair, I\ndon't base this on one book. I read a lot of them, and I'll get like a, for example, I've read books about LBJ, you wouldn't know any of his foibles, but then you find out that they're written by his friend or, you\nknow, it was written by, and you read it through-\n- I just, I really worry about this kind of general, especially now the sense of\nthe anti-establishment sense that every politician must be a sociopath. Now, while it could, the reason I worry about\nthat is it feels true. - Yeah.\n- So it's, you can fall into this bubble of beliefs where every politician is a sociopath and because of that- - It can be self-reinforcing. - Self-reinforcement.\n- Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I agree by the way, we do need\nto dramatically change it. But the problem is, is that, you know, people vote with their eyeballs and with their interests and people love like to, you know, dissect people's personal lives. And one of the reasons why\nyou were probably more likely in the pre-modern era to get\na quote unquote \"good people\" is they were not subject\nto the level of scrutiny and to the insanity of the\nprocess that you are currently. Like I just said about, I mean, theoretically, you\ncould run for president and you would just get your\nnomination at the convention. It's only two months to\nelection day, that's not so bad. But you know, you run for president today, you got your ass on the road for two years and then two years before that, and then you have to\nrun the damn government. So the price is so extraordinarily high. I also think that, oh God, and just Washington\nas a system, it will burn you. It will just, it will extract absolutely everything that you can give it. And at the end of the day, you know, I mean, everyone always talks\nabout this, it's hilarious, how Trump is the only\npresident not to age in office. I think, I actually think it's crazy. Like when you look at the photos of how he actually looks\nbetter today than he did whenever he went into the office. That's amazing. And it actually says a lot\nabout how his mind works. I think Trump is pure id. Like I think he's having\nobserved him a little bit and you know, both at the White House and having interviewed him, it's pure, just like it's calculating,\nbut it's also pure id, which is very interesting. The ones who are the\nthinkers, guys like Obama, and others who are really in\ntheir heads, it's a nightmare. It's a nightmare. They will, I mean, apparently\nObama would only sleep four hours a night, you know? - Yeah, add like some\nempathy on top of that. - Oh.\n- It's gonna destroy you. - It will kill you, man. - All right, speaking about\nthe dirty game of politics, several people, different people told me that of everyone they\nhave ever met in politics, Nancy Pelosi is the best at attaining and wielding political power. Is there any truth to that? - In the modern era?\nYeah, I think that's fair. In the last 25 years, definitely. Let's think about it. Number one is longevity. So she's had the ability\nto control the caucus for a long period of time. So that's impressive\nbecause as I just laid out with Clinton, Obama, and these\nfigures come and they go, but over a 25 almost year period, you've been at the very top in the center of American politics. The other case I would be is that in this modern era has been\ndefined by access to money, she's one of the greatest fundraisers in Democratic Party history. And again, consistently, Obama, Kamala, all those people come and go, but she's always had a\nvery central understanding of the ability to fundraise,\nto cultivate good relationships with Democratic Party elites\nall across the country, used that money and dole\nit out to her caucus. She's also was really good at\nmaking sure that legislation that came to the floor actually\nhad the votes to do so. She ran an extremely well-ordered process in the House of Representatives one in which you were able\nto reconcile like problems within her office. It didn't usually go public and then it would make it to the floor and it would pass so that\nthere would be no general like media frenzy and you\nknow, Democrats in disarray or any of that, put that on display with the Republicans, and we've had multiple speakers all resign or get fired in a 16-year period. That's pretty remarkable. Basically ever since John\nBoehner decided to leave in, what was it, 2012? I forget the exact year. My point is that if you compare her record to the longevity on the\nRepublican side, it is astounding. The other interesting thing is\nthat she also has pulled off, one of the real tests of political power is can you rule even when you don't\nhave the title anymore? So she gave up the leader\nposition to Hakeem Jeffries, but everybody knows she pulled\nJoe Biden out of the race. That's pretty interesting, right? So she's a, technically,\njust a back bencher, nobody member of Congress, but\nwe all know that's bullshit. So that's actually a very important case of political power is can\nyou rule without the title? And if you can, then\nyou truly are powerful. So I would make a good case for her. Yeah, she's done a lot of\nremarkable stuff for her party. I will say they played\nTrump like a fiddle man. Last time around, they were able to, I\nmean they really got him. One of the craziest\nelements that I covered was during the Trump basically threatened to shut down the government\nand actually did shut down the government for a period of time over a dispute over border wall funding and Pelosi and Schumer, despite like genuine mass\nhysteria in the Democratic Party with even some people\nwho are willing to try and to strike a deal, never wavered and actually\nbasically won and forced Trump to back down. Not a lot of MAGA people want to admit it, but that was honestly really embarrassing for the Trump administration at the time. And yeah, I mean the amount\nof discipline that it took for her and for Chuck to a lesser extent, but for the two of them to pull that off, it was honestly impressive\nthat they were able to do that. Even when the president\nhas so much political power and it literally shut down\nthe government over it. - Speaking of fundraising, Kamala raised $1 billion. - Insane. - But I guess the conclusion\nis she spent it poorly. How would you spend it? - I don't think money matters that much. I think Donald Trump\nhas proven to us twice that you can win an underdog\ncampaign through earned media. And I don't think that\npaid advertisement moves the needle that much. Now don't notice, I didn't\nsay that it does matter, but am I buying $425,000 a\nday spots on the Vegas sphere? No, we're not doing that. Are we building? I can't, okay. As people who do this for a living, how do you even spend $100,000 to build a set for one interview? - Is this the Call Her Daddy?\n- The Call Her Daddy thing. - Okay.\n- How's that possible? So think about the dollar per hour cost. That's like running a jet airplane in terms of what they did. You become-\n- You know what I wanna note behind the scenes? - Yeah.\n- Haven't got, and I'm not good with this. I get really frustrated and I shouldn't, but dealing with PR and comms people can sometimes break my soul. - It's maddening. Can we not talk about this and we need to pull them at 2:12 PM, and you're like, but\nthat's only 30 minutes. You know, it's like. - Yeah, that, but there's stuff like, like where to put the camera? It's not that I don't-\n- Oh yeah. - It's not actually hypothetically, I don't even disagree with\nany of the suggestions or, but it's like-\n- The micromanagement. - Just the micromanagement and your, and the politeness, but\nthe fake politeness. And it just makes me feel like, I think like what would Kubrick do? Would he murder all of them right now? - He would just ban them after he became Stanley Kubrick. But he dealt with it for a while. By the way, I just went\non a Kubrick binge, man, he was awesome. - Yeah.\n- I watched that World War I movie of his, the one from the '50s. That is such an underrated film. I feel like people don't, whatever, we'll get past it. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, like, but she, dag yeah, I guess she paid for- - A hundred grand, bro. - A hundred and the Oprah thing, she paid for the interviews. - So, you know, that's another one. I do this for a living and as you can tell, I'm\na very cynical person. I did not even know that\ncelebrities got paid for their endorsements. I could never have imagined a universe where Oprah Winfrey has paid $1 million to endorse Kamala Harris. I'm like, first of all,\nyou're a billionaire. Second, I thought you do\nthis 'cause you believe, you know?\n- No, I think to be fair, I think the million\njust helps do the thing you would like to do. It's like, it's a nudge, 'cause I don't think any\ncelebrity would endorse, like-\n- Yeah, they're not doing it because of the money, but you should just do it for free. I can't even believe that\nyou're doing this for money. I mean, and the fact, what\nwas it, Alanis Morissette, you know how they were able, they had to cut her because they didn't have\nthe funds to pay her. I'm like, first of all, if you believe you should just play for free. But second, again, as a\nperson who is deeply cynical, I still am genuinely shook that we are paying celebrities\nfor their endorsements. - Yeah, it's really fucked up.\n- That's insane. - Why do you think people on the left who are actually in the\npolitical arena are afraid of doing anything longer than an hour? - That's a great question.\n- So let me just say- - Yeah.\n- Probably most of the people I've talked to on this\npodcast are left-wing or have been for a long time. They just don't sort of out and say it like most\nscientists are left-wing. Most sort of vaguely\npolitical people are left-wing that I've talked to. - Yeah.\n- But the closer you get to the actual political arena,\nand I've tried really hard. They just is the, nope,\nI had a bunch of people, the highest profile people say 15 minutes. - Yeah.\n- 20 minutes. - Yeah.\n- And I say, nope. - I'm used to that, so welcome, yeah. (Saagar laughs)\n- Well, I just can't, you know,\nlike I can't imagine a conversation with\nKamala or with Joe Biden or AOC-\n- Obama. - Or Obama that's of any\nquality at all of any, the shows, any kind of\nhumanity of the person, the genius of the person, the interesting nuance of the\nperson in like 30 minutes. Like I just can't, I can't like, I don't know, maybe there's people that\nare extremely skilled that can do that. You just can't. - You should be optimistic because a huge narrative\nout of this election is that the Democrats massively fucked up by not coming on this\nshow or a real good show. So I actually fundamentally, number one, that's gonna change dramatically. - I hope so.\n- So be optimistic and keep pushing. But two is, this is a\ngood segue actually is, I've been thinking a lot about, I know a lot of people\nlistening to this show who are in tech and may have\nsome influence on the admin. So this is kind of some, this is something I want people\nto take really seriously, is I was a White House\ncorrespondent for The Daily Caller. It's a conservative outlet in Washington during the Trump years. And the most important thing\nI learned from that was that under the White House\nCorrespondents' Association, the way that the media\ncartel has everything set up for access for press to the President is fundamentally\nbroken, anti-American, and bad for actual democracy. So let me lay this out at\na very mechanical level 'cause nobody knows this. And I was a former White House Correspondents'\nAssociation member. So anybody who says I'm\nfull of shit, I was there. For example, number one, all\nthe seats in the briefing room, those seats are assigned by the White House\nCorrespondents' Association, not by the White House itself. The White House Correspondents'\nAssociation requires you to apply for a seat, right? That adjudication process\ncan take literally years for bylaws, elections and\nall these things to do. This means that they can\nslow roll the entrance of new media online outlets\nwho are allowed into the room. The reason it really\nmatters not having a seat is if you don't have a seat,\nyou have to get there early and stand in the wings like I used to and raise your hand\nlike this and just hope and pray that the press secretary can see, it's extremely inconvenient. I'm talking, I have to\nget there hours early at a chance during a 15-minute briefing. So one of the things is that Trump has, is he owes a huge part of his election to coming on podcast and to new media. Now because of that, it's really important that the White House\nCorrespondents' Association, which is a literal guild\ncartel that keeps people out of the White House and credentials itself and creates this opaque mechanism through which they control access. You know, to asking the press secretary\nquestions is destroyed. And there are a lot of\ndifferent ways you can do this because nobody gets too is that all of these rules are unofficial. So for example, they're just traditions. The White House is like,\nyeah, it's our building, but you guys figure it out, right? Because that's a longstanding tradition. Let me give you another insane tradition that currently exists in the White House. The Associated Press,\nthe White Press Secretary or the Associated Press correspondent gets to start the briefing, traditionally, they get the first question. They also get to end the briefing when they think it's been enough time, they'll be like, \"Okay,\nCringe Jean Pierre, Thank you,\" right? And that calls the briefing over. What, who? You're not even the White House\nCorrespondents' Association. You literally just happen to\nwork for the associated press. Why? Like why do we allow that to happen? So number one, stop doing that. To their credit, the Trump\npeople didn't really do that, but it's a longstanding tradition. The other thing is that what\nnobody gets either is that the first row is all television networks for logistical reasons. So that they can do their\nlittle standups with their mic and say, \"Oh, I'm reporting\nonline for the White House.\" Well, what people don't\nseem to know is that all the television networks\nare basically going to ask some version of the same question. The reason they do that is\nbecause they need a clip of their correspondent going after the White House Press Secretary\nall out Robert Mueller, like whenever I was there. So you get the same God damn version of the stupid political\nquestions over and over again. The briefing room is designed\nfor traditional media and they have all the access in the world. So in an election where\nyou owe your victory to, at least in part to new media and recognizing and changing landscape, you need to change the\nconduit of information to the American people. And in an election, I\ndon't know if you saw this, but election night coverage\non cable news was down 25%, just in four years, 25%. That's astound, that's\ncable news had a monopoly on election night for my entire lifetime. And yet, my show had\nrecord ratings that night. And I, look, I'm a small\nslice of the puzzle here. We've got Candace Owens,\nPatrick Bet-David, Tim Pool, David Pakman, TYT, all these other people, every, from what I understand, all of us blew it out that night because millions of Americans\nwatched it on YouTube. We even partnered with\nsome, Decision Desk HQ, so we had live data, we\ncould make state calls and we're just a silly\nlittle YouTube show. My point though is that in an election where the vast majority of Americans under the age of 55 are\nlistening to podcasts, consuming new media and are not watching cable news\nwhere the median age of CNN, which is the youngest viewership is 68. 68 is the median. So statistically what\ndoes that tell us, right? There's a decent number of people who are watching CNN who are in their 80s and in their 90s. Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Alex 'cause he deserves a tremendous\nshout out Alex Bruesewitz. He was the pioneer of the podcast strategy for the Donald J. Trump campaign. He got on your show, he was able to get on\nAndrew Schulz's show, Rogan. He was the internal force\nthat pushed a lot of this. My personal hope is that\nsomebody like Alex is elevated in the traditional\nWhite House bureaucracy. That the number of\ncredentials that are issued to these mainstream media outlets is cut. And there is a new lottery\nprocess put in place where people with large\naudiences are invited. And I also wanna make a case here for why I think it's really important for people like you and others who don't have as much\ntraditional media experience to come in and practice\nsome Capital J journalism 'cause it will sharpen you too, giving you access in that\npressure cooker environment and having to really like sit there and spar a little bit\nwith a public official and not have as long\nnecessarily as you're used to. It really hones your news media skills, your news gathering skills. And it will make you a better\ninterviewer in the long run. Because a lot of the\nthings that I have learned have just been through osmosis. I've just lived in DC, I've been so lucky. I've had a lot of cool jobs and I've just been able to\nexperience a lot of this stuff. So I'm really hoping that\npeople who are listening to this who may have some influence\nor even the viewership, if you wanna, you know, reach out to them and all of them, this is a very easily changeable problem. It's a cartel which has no official power. It's all power by tradition\nand it needs to be blown up. It has, it does not\nserve America's interests to have 50, 48 seats, I\nthink in the White House press briefing room with two people who have audiences of like five. It's just makes absolutely zero. Workspace, seats, access, credentials and also, credentials\nthat are issued to press and to other, like new media journalists at major events should take precedence because it's not even about\nrewarding the creator. The American people are\nhere, you need to meet them. That's your job. And I'll just end with a historical thing. Barack Obama shocked the White\nHouse Press Corps in 2009 because he took a question\nfrom The Huffington Post, a brand new blog. But they were stunned because he knew, he\nsaid, \"These blog people, they went all in for me\nand I got to reward them.\" So there's longstanding\nprecedence of this, they'll bitch and they'll\nmoan, they'll be upset, but it's their fault, you know, that they don't have as much credibility and it's incumbent upon the White House, which serves the public to actually meet them where they are. So I really hope that at least some of this is\nimplemented inside of them. - Yeah, if you break apart the cartel, I think you can actually enable\ngreater journalism, frankly. - Of course.\n- With the capital J. Because actually in the long form is when you can do better journalism of, from even just the politician perspective, you can disagree, you can get criticized, 'cause you can defend yourself. - I had an idea, actually. You tell me what you think. I think a really cool format would be, there's a room right near\nthe press briefing room called the Roosevelt Room. Beautiful room by the way, it's awesome. It has the Medal of\nHonor for Teddy Roosevelt and it has a portrait of\nhim and a portrait of FDR. It's one of my favorite\nrooms in the White House. - Okay.\n- It's so cool. And so my idea would be,\nin the Roosevelt Room, which traditionally used for\npress briefings and stuff, is like you as the press\nsecretary sit there, I think there's like 12\nseats, something like that. And you set it all up\nand you have, let's say, Shure microphones like this, and that person, that\nsecretary is gonna commit to being there for like two hours. And new media people like\ncan sit around the room, all of this being\nstreamed live by the way, just like the White House\npress briefing room. But the expectation is that the type of questions\nhave to be substantive. Obviously, nothing is off limits. You should never, ever, you know, except I'm not gonna be asked about this. Especially as a journalist,\nyou can't do that. Every time they're like, \"Hey,\nplease don't ask about this.\" It's like, actually that's probably one thing you should ask about. But my point being that the expectation is that\nthere's no interference on the White House side, but that the format\nitself will lend exactly to what you're saying to\nallow people to explain. And again, in a media era where we need to trust the consumer, like my show is routinely\nover two hours long on cable television. On cable television, you know, the Tucker Carlson program, whenever it was on Fox News, without commercial breaks\nwas about 42, 43 minutes something like that of runtime. So I'm speaking for almost triple what that is on a regular basis. The point is that millions are\nwilling to sit and to listen but you just have to\nmeet them where they are. So I really hope that a format like that, like a streamer briefing or something like that, I think it's, look, I know they would\ndunk on it endlessly, but I think it could work. - Yeah, I think the\nincentives are different. I think it works because\nyou don't have to, like you, Saagar, don't have to signal to the other journalists that\nyou're part of the clique. - Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up because that was another lesson I learned. I go, oh, none of you are\nasking important questions for the people. You're asking questions\nbecause you all hang out with each other and you're like, oh wait. So this entire thing is\na self-reinforcing guild to impress each other at cocktail parties and not to actually ask\nanything interesting. I remember people were so mad at me because, this was 2018 or maybe 2017, and I said, \"Do you think\nthat Kim Jong Un is sincere in his willingness to meet with you?\" Something like that, to that effect. They were furious 'cause\nI didn't ask about some bullshit political controversy that was happening at the time. So in the historical legacy,\nwhat was more important, the Mueller question, or Donald Trump breaking 50 years or whatever of tradition\nwith America's relationship with North Korea and\nmeeting him in Singapore and basically resetting that\nrelationship for all time? As you can tell, I read a lot of book. I like to take the long view. Every time I would ask\na question, I go, okay, when the future Robert\nCaro is writing books and he sees, he's reading the transcript of the White House press briefing, you don't even know who this kid is. He goes, \"Oh, that was a pretty\ngood question right there.\" That's pretty relevant, you know. You got to think about all the bullshit that gets left on the cutting room floor. - I love that view of journalism actually. The goal is to end up as one line in a history book-\n- Yeah. - 50 years from now.\n- I just want a quote of what the president said to something that I ask.\n- Yeah. - In a book, I'd be happy, I would die happy with that. If you told me that when\nI'm like a 90-year-old man, I'd be like, man, and I,\nthat means I succeeded. - Yeah, when the AIs write the history- - Yeah, that's right.\n- Of human civilization. One of the things I\ncontinuously learned from you when looking back through\nhistory is how crazy (Saagar laughing) American politics has\nbeen throughout history. It makes me feel a lot\nbetter about the current day. - It should. - Corruption.\n- Yes. - Just the divisiveness also. - Just the-\n- It's been way worse. - Stealing elections. - Yes. - At all levels of government\nand direct stealing and indirect stealing,\nall kinds of stuff so. Is there stuff that jumps out\nto mind throughout history that's just like the craziest corruptions\nor stealing of elections that come to mind? - I'll give them micro and the macro. So my favorite example is Robert Caro, who I've probably talked about him a lot. God bless you, Robert. I hope you live to write your last book because we really need that from you. But Robert came to Texas, he only intended on writing three books about Lyndon Johnson. He's currently completed\nfour and he is on his fifth and it's taken over 40\nyears to write those. And one of the reasons is\nhe just kept uncovering so much stuff. And one of them is book\ntwo, \"Means of Ascent,\" he never intended to write it. But as he began to\ninvestigate Lyndon Johnson's 1948 Senate election,\nhe realizes in real time how rigged and stolen it was. And so I often tell people, what if I told you that we\nlived in the most secure election period in modern history? - Yeah.\n- They wouldn't believe it. But if you read through that shit, I'm talking about bags of\ncash, millions of dollars, literal stuffed ballot boxes. It's great to be back here in Texas because I always think\nabout that place like down in Zapata and Starr County. I'm talking like basically Mexico, where these dons were\nin power in the 1940s and they would literally\nstuff the ballot boxes with the rolls and they\nwouldn't even allow people to come and vote, they just checkmarked it all\nfor you based upon the amount that you paid. \"Means of Ascent\" is the\npainstaking detail of exactly how Lyndon Johnson stole\nthe 1948 Senate election. And so nothing like that as far as I know is still happening. Macro, we can talk\nabout the 1876 election, Rutherford B. Hayes, one of the closest\nelections in modern history. It was one of those that got kicked with the House of Representative that was an insane, insane time. The corrupt bargain that was struck to basically end reconstruction and federal occupation of the South. And of course, the amount\nof wheeling and dealing that happened inside\nof that was absolutely bonkers and nuts. That was what an actual\nstolen election looks like. Just so people know. So on a micro and a macro, yeah, that's what it really looks like. And so, look, I understand\nwhere people are coming from, also, let's do what, 1960. That was pretty wild. I mean in 1960, there\nwas all those allegations about Illinois going for Kennedy. If you look at the actual vote totals of Kennedy and Nixon, wow. I mean, it's such an insanely\nclose presidential election. And even though the electoral\ncollege victory looks a little bit differently, Nixon would openly talk about, he's like, \"Oh, old Joe Kennedy rigged\nIllinois for his boy.\" And he'd be like, \"And we didn't\neven have a chance in Texas with Lyndon pulling,\" you know, like Lyndon stuffing the\nballot boxes down there. So, and this is open on the, like they openly admit this stuff. They talk about it. So actually there's a funny story. LBJ lost his, I think it's 1941 Senate primary and it's because the, his\nopponent Pappy O'Daniel actually outstole Lyndon. So they were both corrupt. But Pappy O'Daniel stuffed the ballot box in like the fifth day of the\nseven days to count the votes. And FDR loved LBJ. And it's interesting right,\nthat FDR recognized Johnson's, his talent and he goes,\n\"Lyndon, you, you know, in New York we sit on the ballot\nboxes till we count them.\" You know, 'cause he's admitting that he, you know, participated\nin a lot of this stuff. So this high level chicanery of stolen elections is\nactually an American pastime that we luckily have moved on from. And quite a lot of people\ndo not know the exact intricate details of how\nwild it was back in the day. - Yeah, it's actually one of the things, it's harder to pull\noff a bunch of bullshit with all these cameras everywhere now. - Transparency too, lack of\ncash, banking regulations, there's a variety of reasons, but yeah. - So that said, let's talk\nabout the 2020 election. Seems like forever ago. Do you think it was rigged\nthe way that Trump claimed? - No. - And was it rigged in other ways? - Look, this is the problem\nwith language like rigged. And by the way, when I\ninterviewed Vivek Ramaswamy, he said the exact same thing. So for all the MAGA, people\nwho are gonna get mad at me, Vivek agrees, all right? And if, okay, I have observed, and I'm\ngonna put my analyst hat on, there are two theories\nof \"Stop the Steal.\" One I call low IQ \"Stop the Steal\" and one I call high IQ \"Stop the Steal.\" Low IQ \"Stop the Steal\" is basically what Donald Trump has advocated, where, you know, Dominion voting\nmachines and bamboo ballots and Venezuela and Sidney Powell and all the people involved\nbasically got indicted by the State of Georgia. I'm not saying that that was correct, I'm just like, that's what\nthat actually looked like, Rudy Giuliani, et cetera. High IQ \"Stop the Steal\" is basically, and actually, I mean these are\nnot illegitimate arguments. The school of thought\nis, it was illegitimate for the State of Pennsylvania\nand other swing states to change mail-in balloting\nlaws as a response to COVID, which enabled millions of people more to vote that wouldn't have and that those change\nin regulations became enough to swing the election. I actually think that that is true. Now, would you say that that's rigged? That's a very important question 'cause we're talking about a\nRepublican state legislature, a Republican state supreme court, right? The two that actually\nruled on this question. So could you say that it was rigged by the Democrats to do that? Another problem with that theory is that while you can say that that's unfair to change the rules last time around, you can also understand\nit to a certain extent. And I'm not justifying it, I'm\njust giving you an example. So for example, after the\nhurricane hit North Carolina, Republican officials were like,\n\"Hey, we need to make sure that these people who in\nWestern North Carolina, who were affected by the\nhurricane could still be able to have access to the ballot box.\" And people were like,\n\"Oh, so you're saying in an extraordinary circumstance that you should change\nvoting reg, you know, access and regularity to make\nsure that people have access?\" So my point is, you can see the logic through which this happened. And the high IQ version\nis basically the one that was adopted by Josh Hawley whenever he voted against certification. He said that the State of Pennsylvania, particularly election law, and that those changes were unfair and led to the quote unquote\n\"rigging\" of the election against Donald Trump. Now there's an even higher IQ, galaxy brain \"Stop the Steal.\" Galaxy brain \"Stop the\nSteal\" is one that you saw, with great love and\nrespect, my friend JD Vance, at his debate with Tim Walz. When Tim Walz asked him, what did he see, he said, \"Did Donald Trump\nwin the 2020 election?\" He's like, \"Tim, I focus on the future.\" And then he started\ntalking about censorship, the Hunter Biden laptop story. If you take a look at\nthe Joe Rogan interview, Rogan actually asked JD this. He's like, what do you\nmean you in the election? Some version of that. And JD was like, \"Well, what I get really frustrated\nby is people will bring up all these insane conspiracy\ntheories but they ignore that the media censored the\nHunter Biden laptop story and that big tech had\nits finger on the thumb for the Democrats.\" Now that is empirically true, okay? That is true, right? Now would you say that that's rigged? I'm not gonna use that word 'cause that's a very different word. Now, would you say that that's unfair? Yeah, I think it's unfair. So there's another, there's, a lot of MAGA folks picked up on this one. There was a Time Magazine article in 2020 and that's very famous in\ntheir crowd called, you know, it was like the fight\nto fortify the election. And it was about all of these institutions that put their fingers on the scale for Joe Biden against Donald Trump. So I will put it this way. Was Donald Trump up\nagainst the titanic forces of billionaires, tech censorship, and elite institutions who\nall did absolute damnedest to defeat him in 2020? Yes, that is true. And, in a sense, the galaxy brain case\nis the only one of those which I think is truly legitimate. And I'm not gonna put it off the table, but this is the problem, that's not what Trump means. You know, Trump, he, Trump, by the way, will never tell you what\nI just told you, right? JD will. If you go and you ask any of\nthese Republican politicians when they're challenged on it and they don't wanna say that\nTrump a loss of 2020 election, they'll give the the galaxy\nbrain case that I just gave. And again, I don't think it's wrong, but it's like, guys, that's not what he means when he says it. And that's the important\nparsing of the case, right? - So first at a high\nlevel Trump or otherwise, I don't like anyone who\nwhines when they lose, period. - Yeah, although he did tell\nyou he lost, you notice that? That's the only time\nhe's ever said it, ever. You're famous, you're\nin history for that one. - Lost by the whisker.\n- Yeah, yeah. - \"I lost by a whisker.\" - I mean, there is a case to\nbe made that he was joking, I don't know.\n- Yeah. But there is a kind of weaving that he does with humor where sometimes the\nsarcasm, sometimes not, much easier to showcase in a\nthree-hour interview, I'll say. - Good call, go ahead. - I couldn't even like play with that when you have 40 minutes. - I know, bro.\n- You're like, you know, I could do just\n40 minutes on weaving alone. - For your style, it doesn't work. And I can tell you how the\nway I interview politicians is I just do pure policy. So when I, the first\ntime I interviewed Trump, I compiled a list of 15 subjects. Me and my editor, Vince\nCoglianese, shout out to Vince, and the two of us sat in an office and then we had questions by\npriority in each category. And if we felt like we\nwere running short on time, we would move around those different ones. But that was purely, he's the president, we're asking him for his opinions on an immigration bill or whatever. For what you do, it's impossible to do in 40 minutes.\n- Yeah, I just wanna say that thank you for everybody involved, for making my conversation\nwith Donald Trump possible, but I've learned a lot\nfrom that, that I just, if I'm told that all I have is 40 minutes, I'm very politely sparing, in that case, Donald Trump the 40 minutes\nand just walking away 'cause I don't think I could do a good job in 40 minutes.\n- I think that is the correct decision on your part. - [Lex] Yeah. - And also would encourage you to have the confidence at this point that you are in a position of something that we call in the business, the ability to compel the interview. And by to compel means to be able to bring somebody else to you and\nnot the other way around. - Yeah.\n- And, I think that you and Rogan and a few others are in\nthat very unique position. And I would really encourage\nyou guys to stick to your guns on things that make you feel comfortable. Because, you know, those of us in news, we will always negotiate. We'll all, we're willing to do short form 'cause we're asking about policy. But for the style that you help popularize and I think that you're\nuniquely talented and good at, that's very important\nnot to compromise on so. - Thank you for saying those words. And that's not just in\nthe interest of journalism and the interest of conversation, it's the interest of the guest as well. Right?\n- Yeah, absolutely. - [Lex] To bring out the best in them. - Yeah, I mean, I would\nfeel really at a disservice and I would feel like people\nwould not get a unique understanding of like\nmy own thought process and my backstory if I\nwas not able to sit here for literally hours and\nto explain in deep detail like how I think about the world. Not that anyone cares that much, but, you know, it's just like, I hope, all I can do,\nis I hope it's helpful. I wanna help people think because when I was growing, I was growing up not far from here, 90 minutes from here in College Station, I felt very uniquely\nclosed off from the world. And I found the world through books. And books saved my life. They've been many, so\nmany different times. And I hope to encourage\nthat in other people. I really, no matter where you\nare, no matter who you are, no matter how busy you\nare, you have some time to either sit down with a\nbook or put on an audiobook and you can transport yourself\ninto a different world. It's so important. And that's something that your show really helps me with too. I love listening to your show whenever, sometimes when I'm too into politics and I need to listen to something, I'll listen to that Mayan historian guy. I love stuff like that. Absolutely.\n- I've been a deep dive on Genghis Kahn. Reading \"Genghis Kahn and the\nMaking of the Modern World.\" - Yeah, Jack Weatherford. Fantastic.\n- Yeah, he's coming on. - Is he? - Yeah.\n- Amazing. And again, shout out to Dan Carlin. - The goat, the OG, Dan, I've never met you before. I would love to have\ncorrespondence at some point. I love you so much. You changed my life, man. - I met him once before and it felt I mean I was,\n- I listened in your interview with him, it was amazing.\n- I was starstruck. Very, very starstruck. And his, I mean there's so much \"Painfotainment\" that I've listened to many times.\n- You know, I think his best series, one of his best\nseries he gets no credit for, \"Ghost of the Ostfront.\" Nobody gives him credit for that one. That's OG, this is 2011 series. But his \"Ghost of the\nOstfront\" on the eastern front of the Nazi war against\nRussia fundamentally changed my view of warfare forever. And also, at that time I was very young, and to me, World War II\nwas \"Saving Private Ryan.\" I wasn't as well read as I am now. And I was like, oh, shit,\nthis entire thing happened, which actually decided\nthe Second World War and I don't know anything about this. So shout out to Dan, God bless you, man. - And his quote unquote \"short episodes,\" I think on slavery in general\nthroughout human history- - That was an awesome episode. I actually bought a bunch\nof Hugh Thomas books because of that episode. I'd never really read\nabout African slavery or the slave trade outside\nof the Civil War context. So again, shout out to him for that one. That was an amazing episode. His Japan series too. I'm going to Japan in a few days. - Yeah.\n- And I keep thinking of what\nhe always talked about in his \"Supernova in the East,\" \"The Japanese are like everyone\nelse, but only more so.\" And, God, I love that quote. - Okay, he's great. And we, ironically arrived at this tangent while talking about the 2020 election. - Yeah, yeah. That's why podcasting is fun. - 'Cause you said lost by a whisker. - [Saagar] Yeah. - And now we're dragging us screaming back to the topic. One of the things I was\nbothered by is Trump claiming that there's widespread, as\nyou're saying, low IQ theory. - Yeah.\n- The widespread voter fraud. And I saw no evidence of\nthat that he provided. And all right, well that's,\nlet's put that on the table. And then the other thing I was troubled by that maybe you can comfort\nme in the context of history, how easily the base ate that up. - Yeah.\n- That they were able to believe the election\nwas truly rigged based on no clear evidence that I saw. And they just love the story. And there is something\ncompelling to this story that, you know, like this\nDNC type, like with Bernie, the establishments just, they're corrupt, and they steal the will of the people. And like the lack of desire from the base or from people\nto see any evidence of that, what's really troubled me. - Yeah, I'm gonna give you one of the most depressing quotes, which is deeply true. Roger Ailes, who is a genius, shout out to \"The Loudest Voice in the\nRoom\" by Gabriel Sherman. That book changed my life too because it really made\nme understand media. \"People don't wanna be informed,\nthey wanna feel informed.\" That is one of the most fundamental media insights of all time.\n- What the fuck, what a line. - Roger Ailes. A genius. A genius in his own right. Who, you know, he changed the world. He certainly did. He, you know, he's the one\nwho kind of gets credit for one of the greatest\ndebate lines of all time 'cause he was an advisor\nto President Reagan. Whenever he broke in, he was like, \"Mr. President, people wanna know if you're too damn old\nfor this job or not.\" And he inspired that joke that Reagan made where he was like, \"I will\nnot use age in this campaign. I will not hold my opponent's youth and inexperience against him.\" That was Ailes, man. You got, he did the Nixon Town Halls. He did it all, he's a fucking genius. And I'm not advocating necessarily for the world he created for us, but he did it and people\nshould study him more. If you're interested\nin media in particular, that book is one of the\nmost important books you'll ever read. - Yeah, you know what, that quote just really connected with me. - Yes.\n- 'Cause, you know, there's all\nthis talk about truth and I think what people wanna, they want to feel like they're\nin possession of the truth. - Correct.\n- Not actually being in the possession of the truth. - Yeah, I know. It's one\nof the, it hit me too. Actually, Russell Crowe\ndoes an amazing job of delivering that line in\nthe Showtime miniseries. So if you have the chance,\nyou should watch it. And look, this is the problem. Liberals will be like, \"Yeah,\nsee these idiot Republicans.\" I'm like, yeah, you guys have bought a lot of crazy stupid shit too, okay? And if actually I would say\n\"liberal misinformation,\" quote unquote, is worse than\nRepublican disinformation because it pervades the entire\nelite media like Russiagate or Cambridge Analytica or\nany of these other hoaxes that have been foisted\non the American people. The people who listen to The Daily and from the New York Times\nare just as brainwashed, lack of informed, wanna feel informed as people who watch Fox News. So let me just say that out there, it's an equal opportunity\ncancer in the American people. - Actually, we started early on in the conversation talking about bubbles. What's your advice about how to figure out if you're in a bubble\nand how to get out of it? - Oh, that's such a fantastic question. Unfortunately, I think\nit comes really naturally to someone like me because\nI'm the child of immigrants and I was raised in\nCollege Station, Texas, so I was always on the outside. And when you're on the outside,\nthis isn't a sob story. It's a deeply useful skill because when you're on the outside, you're forced to kind of observe. And you're like, \"Oh.\" So like where I was\nraised was the Bible Belt and people really, you know, people were hardcore\nevangelical Christians. And I could tell, I'm like,\nthey really believe this stuff and, you know, they, you know, were always trying\nto proselytize and all of that. And then the other gift\nthat my parents gave me is I got to travel the entire world. I probably visited 25, 30\ncountries by the time I was 18. And one of the things that\nthat gave me was the ability to just put yourself in the\nbrain of another person. So one of the reasons I'm\nreally excited to go to Japan, and I picked it as a spot\nfor my honeymoon, was because Japan is a first world developed country where the vast majority of\nthem don't speak English. It's distinguishably non-Western and they just do shit their own way. So they have a subway, but\nit's not the same as ours. They have restaurants, things\ndon't work the same way. They have, you know, I\ncould go a laundry list. Their entire philosophy of\nlife, of the daily rhythm, even though it merges with service-based managerial capitalism and\nthey're fucking good at it too, they do it their own way. So exposure to other countries\nin the world gave me, and also just being an outsider myself, gave me a more detached view of the world. So if you don't have that, what I would encourage you\nis to flex that muscle. So go somewhere that\nmakes you uncomfortable. This will be a very boomer take, but I hate the fact that you\nhave 5G everywhere you go in the world. Because some of the best experiences I've ever had in my life is\nwalking around Warsaw, Poland, trying to find a bus station to get my ass to Lithuania\nwith a printed out bus ticket. I have no idea where the street is. I'm in a country where not\nthat many people speak English. We're pointing and gesturing, right, and I figured it out. And it was really used, I got to meet a lot of cool Polish people. Same in Thailand. I've been in rural like\nbumfuck, Thailand, Colombia, places where people speak zero English. And your ability to gesture and use pigeon really connects you and\ngives you like the ability to get an exposure to others. And so, I know this is a very like wanderlust like travel thing, but unironically, if you're\nraised in a bubble, pierce it. Like that's the answer\nis seek something out that makes you uncomfortable. So if you're raised rich, you need to go spend some\ntime with poor people. - And consider that they\nmight actually understand the world better than you. - Well, in some respects. So I think a lot of rich people have really\nscrewed up personal lives. So if you're poor and\nyou really value family, you say, \"Oh, that's interesting.\" There seems to be a fundamental trade off between extraordinary wealth\nand something that I value. But what can I take away from that person? Oh, put my money in index funds. Make sure that I am\nconscientious about my budgeting, common sense shit, right? And say vice versa. People who are very\nwealthy get so caught up in the rat race about their\nkids going to private school and all of this. And then, you know, they\nvery rarely engage with, there's that famous study where they ask people on their deathbed like what they valued in life. And every single one of them was like, \"I wish I'd spend more\ntime with my children,\" I think about that every time that I am thinking about\npursuing a new work endeavor or something that's gonna\nhave me spend significant time away from my wife. And almost always these days, now that I've achieved a\ncertain level of success, the answer is I'm not doing it\nunless you can come with me. - One of the bubbles I'm really concerned about is San Francisco bubble. I visited there recently 'cause there's, I have so many friends\nthere that I respect deeply. There's so many brilliant people- - Absolutely, absolutely.\n- In San Francisco. The Silicon Valley. But there's just this, I don't even want to criticize it, but there's definitely a bubble. - Yeah.\n- Of thought. - I'm with you. I'm friends with some SV,\nSilicon Valley people as well. I'm similarly struck by\nthat every time I go. And honestly, I do admire them, because they, what I respect\nthe most amongst entrepreneurs, business and political\nthinkers is systems thinking. Nobody thinks systems better than people who are in tech.\n- Yeah. - Because they deal\nwith global shit, right? Not even just America. They have to think about the whole world, about the human being and his\nrelationship with technology And coding in some ways is an\nexpression of the human mind and about how that person\nwants to achieve this thing. And how you mechanically can\ntype that into a keyboard or even code something to code for you to be able to achieve that. That's a remarkable accomplishment. I do think those people, and people like that too,\nwho think very linearly through math and they're,\nthe geniuses are the ones who can take their creativity and merge it with linear thinking, but I do think that that\nactually, those are the people who probably most need\nto get out of the bubble, check themselves a little bit. And, look, it's really hard, you know, once you achieve a certain\nlevel of economic success and others, like what\ndo most rich people do? They close themselves off\nfrom the world, right? The vast majority of the time, what do you do? Economy is annoying, flying,\nthey fly first class. Living a small house is annoying. They buy a bigger house. Dealing with a lot of these inconveniences of life is annoying. You pay a little bit more to make sure you don't have to do that. There's a deep insidious\nthing within that. Each one of those individual choices, where the more and more\nremoved that you get from that, the more in the bubble that you are. So you should actually\nseek out those experiences or create them in a concerted way. - Speaking of bubbles, Sam Harris. - Oh. - He has continued to criticize me directly and indirectly, I think unfairly, but I love Sam. I deeply respect him. Everybody should listen to\nthe \"Making Sense\" podcast. It always makes me think. It's definitely in the rotation for me. - That's a very admirable view. - I mean, he's, I think,\none of the sharpest minds of our generation. And for a long time I looked up to him, it was one of the weird\nmoments for me to meet him 'cause you listen to somebody\nfor such a long time. - I feel that way with you. (Lex laughing) I'm serious. - Yeah, it was, it's a beautiful moment. I mean, same with Joe and stuff like this.\n- Oh, absolutely. - It's-\n- It is one of the most surreal moments of your life to be able to meet somebody who you spend like hours listening to. I actually think about that\nwhen people come up to me. Because I'm like, oh,\nthey're feeling what I felt whenever I...\n- Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And you have to like,\nyou see it, you feel it, and you have to celebrate that because there's an intimacy to it. - [Saagar] Uh-huh. - I think it's real that\npeople really do form a real connection, a real friendship. It happens to be one way, but I think it actually can upgrade to a two-way pretty easily. It happens with me like in a\nmatter of like five minutes when I meet somebody at an\nairport or something like that. Anyway, Sam took a pretty\nstrong position on Trump. - And has for a long time. - Yeah, he has been\nconsistent and unwavering. So he thinks that Trump is\na truly dangerous person for a democracy, for maybe for the world. Can you steel man his position? - Well, you see, I think a lot of this podcast has been steelmanning it because Sam is a big\ncharacter matters guy. Like, he focuses a lot\non Trump's personality. By the way, I'm like you, I've listened to Sam Harris for years. I bought his meditation app. So nobody's gonna accuse me of\nbeing some Sam Harris hater. I listened to him for way before, long before even Donald Trump was elected. That's how far back I go\nwith the Sam Harris podcast. I have a lot of respect for the dude. I enjoy a lot of his older interviews. I do think after Trump, he\ndid succumb a little bit, in my opinion, to the\nelite liberalism view, both of the impetus behind Donald Trump and why he was able to be successful. So in some ways, very\ndenigrating to the Trump voter, but also a fundamental misunderstanding of the American presidency. Because like I said, he really\nis the one who believes that that narcissism, that character, and all of that that makes Trump\ntick itself will eventually override any potential benefit\nthat he could have in office. And I just think that's a really\nwrong way of looking at it. And I mean, for example, I\nhad this debate with Krystal, and this gets to the\nwhole Trump, you know, talking about the enemy from within. And she was like, \"He wants to prosecute\nhis political opponents. Do you disagree with that?\" And I was like, \"No, I don't.\" And she was like, \"So you're\nnot worried about it?\" And I go, \"No, I'm not.\" And she's like, \"Well,\nhow do you square that?\" And I was like, \"Well, I\nactually unironically believe in the American system of institutional checks and balances,\" which kept him quote unquote\n\"in check\" last time around. I also believe in democracy where, you know, this is really interesting. But you know, in 2022,\na lot of the Republicans who were the most vociferous\nabout \"Stop the Steal,\" they got their asses\nkicked at the ballot box. You know, Americans also\nthen in 2024 decided to forgive some of that from Donald Trump. It's definitely didn't help, right? But they were able to oversee\nthat for their own interests. As in democratically,\npeople are able to weigh in terms of checks and balances what they should and should\nnot challenge a politician by. But also, we have the\nAmerican legal system, and I also know the way\nthat the institutions in Washington themselves work that, you know, fundamentally, the\nway that certain processes and other things could\nplay out will not play out to some Hitlerian fantasy. And this gets to the whole like Kamala and them calling him a fascist and Hitler, you know, you and I probably\nspent hours of our lives, maybe more, thinking and\nreading about Adolf Hitler, Weimar, Germany and a certain, and I just find it so insulting, you know, because it becomes this moniker\nof like fascist, you know, I say these terms have meaning beyond just the dictionary definition, the circumstances through\nwhich Hitler is able to rise to power are not the same as today. It's like, stop denigrating\nAmerica to the point where you think like, really\nyou should flip it around. Why do you think America\nis Weimar, Germany? That's a ridiculous thing to say. Do you unironically believe that? No, you don't believe that. So that is personally what\ndrives me a little bit crazy. And I think that Sam has\nfound in a mental framework where he's not willing, he's not able to look past the man and his quote unquote \"danger.\" And at the end of the day,\nhis worldview was rejected wholly by the American people. And that, 'cause the character argument, the fascist argument, the Hitler argument, he's uniquely bad argument\nhas been run twice before 2016 and in 2000, actually, all three times, I guess it won in 2020. But two out of the three times Donald Trump has won the presidency. And in his latest one, where that argument has\nnever been made before for a longer period of time and more in strength by\na political candidate, was rejected completely. And I would ask him to reconcile himself to the America that he lives in. - I think one thing maybe to partially steel man his case, but also just to steel man, the way the world works is\nthat there is some probability that Kamala Harris will institute a communist state. And there is some probability\nthat Donald Trump will indeed, that like will fly a swastika. - Right.\n- With and deport, I don't know everybody\nwho's not Scot-Irish. Like, I don't know. - Yeah. You and I are screwed then. - Maybe is there a spirit test? Okay. Like, but that probability\nis small and you have to, if you allow yourself to focus\non a particular trajectory with a small probability, it can become all encompassing 'cause you could see it,\nyou could see a path. There's certain character\nqualities to Trump. - [Saagar] Yes. - Where he wants to hold onto power. First of all, every politician\nwants to hold onto power. Joe Biden, maybe because\nhe's part of the machine, can't even conceive of the\nnotion of a third term. But he has the arrogance\nto want to hold onto power, do everything he can. - Absolutely. - And like with Trump, I could see that if it was very popular for\nhim to have a third term, I think he would not be the kind of person who doesn't advocate for a third term. - So what? That would require the Senate and the House or 70, what is\nit, 75% of the states to pass and change the Constitution. Do you think that's gonna happen? No, I don't think it's gonna happen. So I'm not that worried about it. Now, you can make a norms argument, and I actually think that's kind of fair, is that he's the norms buster. But you know, with\nextraordinary candidates and people like Trump, you get the good and the bad. There is the true duality, like the norms he busts\naround foreign policy, I love. The norms he busts around\nthe economy, I love. The norms he busts around just so much of the\nAmerican political system, saying it, how it's et\ncetera, I love that. You know what I hate? This 2020 election bullshit. You know what else I hate, you know, this, I don't know, just the lack of discipline that I would want to think that a great leader could have. Like when he was president and tweeting about Mika\nBrzezinski's facelift, that was objectively ridiculous. Like it was crazy. Okay. Was it funny? Yeah, but it was crazy. Like, and it's not how I would conceive and have conceived of some\nof my favorite presidents. I wouldn't think that they would do that, but that's what you get. You know, you, everyone\nshould be clear-eyed about who this man is. And that's another problem. The deification of politicians is sick. It's sickening like about\nTrump, around Obama, around like, these people are just people. Like the idea that they\nare God-like creatures with extraordinary judgment. You know, one of the really cool things about you and I's job is\nwe actually get to meet very important people. After you meet a few billionaires, you're like, yeah, there's\ndefinitely something there. But you know, some of them get lucky. Like after you meet a few\npoliticians, you're like, oh, they're like, they're not that smart. That was a rude awakening\nfor me, by the way, being here in Texas,\nreading about these people. And pretty soon I was on Capitol Hill, I was like 19 years old, I was an intern. I'm actually interacting\nand I see them behave in ridiculous manners and, you know, whatever,\ntreat people badly or say something stupid. And I was like, oh, I'm like,\nthis is not \"The West Wing.\" I'm like, this is not like a book. These people are just,\nthis is just reality. And the weirdest part of\nmy life is I've now been in Washington long enough. I know some of the people personally, the vice president of the United States, literally, the vice president-elect, future cabinet secretaries,\nfuture, you know, these people I literally\nhave met, had dinner with, had a drink with whatever,\nthat's a wild thing. And that's even more\nbringing you down to earth. You're like, oh shit, you're actually gonna have a lot of power. That's kind of scary. But you're just a person. And so even though you don't have to say, I have my same life experience, take it from me or anybody else who's ever met really famous people, rich, successful, powerful people, they're just people. There's nothing that, there's some things that\nare unique about them, but they have just as many\nhuman qualities as you or anybody else who's\nlistening to this right now. - Yeah, there's, for each candidate, Trump is probably the\nextreme version of that. There's a distribution of\nthe possible trajectories that administration might result in. - Yes.\n- And like, the range of possible trajectories is just much wider with Trump. - Yeah, you're describing\nlike a Bayesian theory, right? Like, and I think that's actually\na really useful framework for the world is that people\nare really too binary. So like you said, you know, there's a theoretical possibility, I guess, of a communist\ntakeover of government and of a fascist takeover of government under Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. You know, the realistic\nprobability I would give it 0.05% probably in both directions. But there are, you know,\nthere are a lot of things that can happen that are bad, that are not Hitlerian and or fascist. There are a lot of things that\nhappen that are really good, that are not FDR New Deal style. One of the worst things\npoliticians do is they describe themselves in false historical ways. So in Washington, one of the most overused\nphrases is made history. And I'm like, you know, if\nyou actually read history, most of these things are just,\nthey're not even footnotes. They're the stuff that\nthe historians flip past. And they're like, what\na stupid bucking thing. I mean, and I'm talking\nabout things that will, that ruled American politics. Like what if I told you that the Panama Canal Treaty was one\nof the most important fights in modern American politics? Nobody thinks about that today. It ruled American politics\nat that time, you know, it genuinely is a footnote, but that's not how it felt at the time. So that's another thing I\nwant people to take away. - You tragically missed the UFO hearings. - Oh man, my brothers, I'm really sad. - My brothers. (chuckles) - Let me tell you. - Yeah.\n- I love them so much. The UFO community are\nsome of the best people I've ever met in my life. Shout out to my brother Jeremy Corbell, to George Knapp, the OG, to all of the people who fly\nfrom all around the world to come to these hearings. It was so fun. I got to meet so many of them last time. Just walk the rope line like as people were\ncoming in, the excitement, I truly love the UFO community. Shout out to all of us. - This is the second one, I guess. - This is the second one. - Do you hope they continue happening? - It's gonna be a slow burn. So one of the things\nI always tell the guys and everybody is consider how long it took to understand the sheer insanity of the CIA in the 1950s and '60s. So if we think back to\nthe church committee. I forget the exact year\nof the church committee. I think it was in the '70s, the entire church committee\nand knowledge of why this, of how the CIA and the FBI were up to all of this insane shit\nthroughout the '50s and '60s is because some people\nbroke into a warehouse, discovered some documents, got the names of programs\nwhich were able to be FOIA'd and we were able to break open that case. It would never have happened\nwith real transparency, like in the official process. So we owe those people a great debt. I guess I could say now the statute of limitations has passed. My point about the UFOs is I\ndon't know what is real or not. I have absolute confidence and absolute ton is being\nhid from the American people and that all of the official\nexplanations are bullshit. I have had the opportunity to interface with some of the whistleblowers\nand other of the activists and the community people who I trust, people who have great credentials, who have no reason to lie, who have assured us that\nthere is a lot going on behind the scenes. There has been too much misinformation and effort by the deep state\nto cover up this topic. So I would ask people to keep the faith. It's 2024 and we still don't\nhave all the JFK files, okay? Everyone involved is dead. There's no reason to let it go. And even though we basically\nknow what happened, we don't know. If you read that fantastic book, the Tom O'Neill book\nabout the Manson murders. I mean, again, you know, it\ntook him 20 years to write that book and he still\ndidn't get the full story. So sometimes it takes\nan extraordinarily long agonizing period of time. And I know how deeply frustrating that is. But when you think about a secret, a program and knowledge of this magnitude, it would only make sense that it would require a titanic effort to reveal a titanic secret. - You think Trump might\nbe able to push further, like aggressively break\nthrough the secrecy, let's say even on the JFK files? - I hope so, I have moderate confidence. You know, RFK Junior\nhas pushed him to do so. I would like to think so. At the same time I saw\nhim got rolled last time. So I'm, you know, I'll hold my breath. - Why do you think that happens? Why do you think it gets- - Remember that whole interagency\nthing I told you about? That's how it happens. That's another thing. You're presuming that the\npresident has the power to declassify this stuff. I'm saying that I'm not\neven sure we're there. Like in terms of- - So it's basic like stability.\n- Yeah. - He basically says like, \"I would like to declassify JFK files.\" And they say, \"Yes, sir, we'll get that to you in three months.\" And three months comes by. And then they're like, \"Well,\nthere's these hurdles.\" - Well, the way you get around it is go, \"Let's release some. But these in particular, there's\nnational security secrets. There's a good case for not\nreleasing them X, Y and Z.\" You know, it's like you get around that, you go, \"Oh, okay.\" You know, that makes sense, you know. And again, he's a busy guy. He's the president, he got way\nbigger shit to worry about. So this is the, that's the problem is that unless you have that true urgency, I mean, look, people of\nimmense power have tried, everyone forgets this. John Podesta was the White\nHouse Chief of Staff. He's a UFO true believer in his heart. He tried, he's talked about it. He tried at the top level, the number two to the White\nHouse to get the Pentagon and others to tell him what was going on and they stonewalled him. So people need to understand\nwhat you're up against. And you know, I would, and people are like, how\nis that even possible? It's like, well, go read\nabout the terror that LBJ and the Kennedys and\nothers had in confronting J. Edgar Hoover, go and read how terrified,\nyou know, Eisenhower, and some of them were\nof the Dulles brothers. They were scared. Like they knew where the power lies. So, you know, the presidency, look, government, deep state, et cetera, they've been there a long time and they know what's happening\nand presidents come and go, but they stay forever. And so that's the paradigm that you're gonna have to fight against. - Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of a meme, but I wonder how deep the deep state is. - Much deeper than\nanyone can even imagine. And the worst part is with the deep state is\nit's not even individuals. It's actually an ideology. And ideology is the most power. You know, people often think that if we took money out of politics, that it would change everything. I'm not saying it wouldn't\nchange everything, but it wouldn't change a lot. But people are like, \"Oh, so-and-so's only\nagainst universal healthcare 'cause they're getting paid.\" I'm like, no, no, no. That's not why they actually believe it. Or it's like, \"Oh, so-and-so's\nonly wants to advocate for war with Iran because\nthey're on the payroll of APAC.\" And it's like, well, yeah, the APAC trips and the money helps, but they think that,\nactually, the system itself, this is a very Chomsky as\nsystemic critique, is that, any journalist worth their salt\nwould never have the ability to get hired in a mainstream. So he's like, it's not that you're bad in the mainstream media, it's that anyone good is\nnot allowed to be elevated to your position because\nthey have an ideology. And so, you know, that is\nthe most self-reinforcing, pernicious mechanism of them all. And that's really\nWashington in a nutshell. - It's again, a bubble, but a bubble that has a lot of power. - Yes.\n- Who do you think is the future of the\nRepublican party after Trump? What happens to Trumpism after Trump? - Like you just said, Bayesian,\nlet's take various theories. - Yes.\n- Right? So let's say it's '04, it's Bush Cheney. In 2004, the day after the election, I would've told you this, we live in a Bible belt,\nJesus land America, this America wants to protect America, a war on terror against Iraq and the axis of evil and American people just\nvoted for George W. Bush. And so I would've predicted that it would've been\nsomebody in that vein. And they tried that. His name was John McCann got\nblown the out by Barack Obama. So I cannot sit here and confidently say, - What year would you be\nable to predict Obama? It was just his first\ntime he gave the speech, - The 2004 speech at the DNC. That was his, we don't\nlive in Black America, white America, the John Kerry, DNC speech. You honestly could not\nhave predicted it until '07 whenever he actually\nannounced his campaign and activated a lot of anti-war energy. I mean, maybe '06, actually, I could have said\nin '06 if I was, you know, kind of the contrarian man now I'm like, yeah, there's\na lot of anti-war energy. I think the next\npresident will be somebody who's able to vote. You know, the explosion of\nKeith Olbermann and MSNBC that, it makes logical sense in hindsight, but you know, at the same\ntime you're going up against the Clinton machine who's\nnever lost an election. So I would've been afraid. I cannot confidently say, so I'll say if things go\nin different directions, if Trump is a net positive president, then I think it'll be JD Vance, his vice president who believes in the, a lot of the things that\nI've talked about here today about foreign policy restraint,\nabout the working class, about changing Republican\nattitudes to the economy. And he would be able to\nbuild upon that legacy in the way that George H.W Bush was able to get elected off the back of Reagan. But H.W Bush was\nfundamentally his own man. He's a very misunderstood figure. Very different than Ronald Reagan, didn't end up working out\nfor him, but you know, he did get himself elected once. So that's one path. That's if you have a net\npositive Trump presidency. The other path is the '04\npath that I just laid out. If George W. Bush, if\nTrump does what Bush does, misinterprets his mandate,\nscrews things up, creates chaos, and it makes it just generally annoying to live in American society, then you will see somebody\nin the Republican party. I mean still it could even be JD Vance. 'cause he could say JD is my natural and my chosen successor, but then he would lose an election and then he would no longer\nbe the so-called leader of the Republican Party. So I could see it swing\nin the other direction. I could see, you know,\nRepublicans or others, let's say if it's a total disaster and we'd get down like\n20% approval ratings and the economy is bad\nand stuff like that. Glenn Youngkin or somebody like that who's very diametrically\nopposed to Donald Trump, or at least you know,\naesthetically is somebody like that who could rise from the ashes. And I'm just saying like\nin terms of his aesthetic, not him per se. So there's a variety of\ndifferent directions. It's a big question about\nthe Republican base. I mean, a shit ton of\npeople voted Republican now for the first time ever. So are they gonna vote in party primaries? I don't know. You know, the traditional\nparty primary voter is like a white boomer is like 58, 59, is the Latino guy in California who turned out to vote\nfor Trump with a MAGA hat and rolling around, you know, suburban Los Angeles with that. Is he gonna vote in the Republican party? That could change, so the type of candidate\nthemselves could come. So this just, it's way too\nearly to say, you know, we have so many variety\npaths that we go down. - Yeah, I think Trump is a singular figure in terms of like, if\nyou support Trump there, I just, there's a vibe. I know Kamala has a vibe, but there's definitely\na vibe to Trump and MAGA and I just, I think even with JD, that that's no longer going to be there. So if JD runs and wins, that would be on principles and he's a very different human being. - He is so different than Trump, right? You can see his empathy, right? Remember in the VP debate when he was like, \"Christ, have mercy\" when Tim Wallace was\ntalking about his son. I mean, that's not something\nDonald Trump's saying, okay, he's just not like in terms of, I mean, you know, and this, by the way, this\nis my own bubble test. I have no idea how\nsomebody listens to Trump and JD Vance is like, Trump is the guy who should\nbe the president over him. I honestly, I don't get it. That's my own cards on the table. I am in too much of a bubble where I am, my bias is to, you know, being well-spoken and being empathetic or at least being able to play empathetic and being extremely well-read\nabout the world and thoughtful and somebody who's, you know, somebody like him who's engaged\nin the political process, but also has been able\nto retain his values and be extremely\nwell-articulate his worldview. That's my bias. That's who I would want\nto be the president. But you know, that's a big country. People think differently - By the way. I Sure you're bias. - Yeah.\n- And I sometimes try to take myself out of that bubble. Like it's maybe it's not\nimportant to have read a book or multiples of books on history. - I'm not saying everybody\nshould be like me, but that's my point. I'm checking myself by being\nlike, because of who I am, that's how I see the world, and that's how I would choose a leader. But that is not how people vote, period. And I've, nothing has taught me that more than this election. - I wish they did, I mean,\nI don't know if that, I don't know if that's the\nlesson to take away, I think. - Yeah, but who are we to\nsay people are allowed to do what they want. You know, I'm not gonna\ntell somebody how to vote. - No, what I'm saying is\nyou take everything Trump, everything Trump is doing,\neverything, the whole, the dance, all of it, and add occasional saga like references to history books. I think that's just a better candidate. - I agree with you. I mean, listen, you know, it's my bias. - Yeah. I don't know.\n- Yeah. - I don't think that's bias. I think that's not\nbubble thinking, I think. - It's amazing to me, right? Like listen to the JD\ninterview with Rogan. I mean JD, I mean, he'll\ndrop obscure references to studies to like papers that have come out, essays, books. Like this is a very well-read high IQ, well-thought out individual\nwho also, you know, has given his life to the\npolitical process, right? And decided to like deal\nwith all the bullshit that this entire system\nis gonna throw at you whenever you start to engage. That's who I would wanna be president. But you know, I'm biased,\nso what can I say? - I like how you keep\nsaying you're biased. - Yeah.\n- As if there's some percent of the population doesn't\nlike people to read at all. Okay. What about the future? You kind of hinted at it the\nfuture of the Democratic Party. - Yeah.\n- Did you see any talent out there that's promising? Is it gonna be Obama-like figure that just rolls out of nowhere? - Clinton is the better example because the Democratic Party\nwas destroyed for 12 years, from 1980, the 1980 election to 1992. They're 12 years out of power in periods of that long of an era, it takes somebody literally\nbrand new who is not tainted by the previous to convince\nthe base that you can won and convince the country that you're going in a new direction. So I would not put my\nmoney on anybody tainted by the Great Awokening by TDS, by the insanity of the Trump era that has to be somebody post that and/or somebody who is\nable to reform themselves. It will, in my opinion, it will likely not be any\nestablishment politician of today who will emerge for the future. Like I said, my dark horse is Dean, I think the Democratic\nbase is gonna give Dean a shit ton of credit, and they\nshould, for him being out. - Interesting.\n- And look, let's be honest, he is a no-name\ncongressman from Minnesota. Nobody cared who Dean Phillips was, but just like Obama, he\nhad courage and he came out and spoke early when it mattered. And by doing that, he showed good judgment and he showed that he's\nwilling to take risks. So I would hope in\nAmerica's political system that we award something like that. And I do think the\nDemocrats will reward him, but I'm not saying it'll be him per se, but it will be a figure like that who is not nationally known, who has read the tea leaves correctly, who took guesses and did things differently\nthan everybody else. And most of all, I'm hoping\nthat heterodox attitudes, ideas, behaviors, by\ndefinition after a blowout, those will likely be the\nones that are rewarded. So I cannot give a name, but I can just describe the circumstances for what it will look like. - Can you imagine an amorphous figure that's a progressive populist? - It would be very difficult at this point just because a huge portion of the multiracial working\nclass has shifted to the right. But I could see it, I mean, look, people change\ntheir minds all the time. Like there are people out there\nwho voted for Barack Obama who've now voted for\nDonald Trump three times. So, you know, a lot can\nchange in this country. If you make a credible case,\nyou've got a track record, you speak authentically, and you can try to divide\nthe country along class lines and be authentic and real about it. Maybe I think you have a shot. I still think you're probably\ngonna get dinged on culture, just because I think this\nelection has really showed us how important immigration and culture is. But you know, actually, what the left populist should pray for, and they won't admit this, is that Trump actually solves immigration. Like in terms of changing the status quo. You know how, in the way that\nthe Supreme Court just ended the conversation around gay marriage. So all Republicans were\nlike, yeah, whatever. We support gay marriage. Because they're like,\nthat's the law of the land. It is what it is. They should just hope that their unpopular issue\nis resolved by the president and thus they just don't have\nto talk about it anymore. And now the battleground is\nactually favorable for them. They get to talk about\nthe economy and abortion. So their least popular issue gets solved by the president by\nconsensus from his mandate. And then they can run\non a brand new platform for the new issues that\nare facing America. - All right, let's put\nour historian hat back on. - Okay.\n- Will the American Empire collapse one day? And if it does, when it does,\nwhat would be the reason? - Statistically likely, (Lex laughing)\nthe, (laughs) statistically yes. You know, it's the\nfamous Fight Club quote. It's like, \"On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for\neverything drops to zero.\" And you know... - I like for all the books you've quoted. - Yeah.\n- You went to Fight Club. - Okay.\n- I guess the movie, right? - The book's good though,\npeople should read that too, in terms of why, again, statistically the\nanswer's quite simple. It usually comes back to a\nseries of unpopular wars, which are pursued because\nof the elite's interests. Then it usually leads to a miscalculation and a not a catastrophic defeat normally, it comes gradually. And most of the times\nwhen these things end, the crazy part is most\npeople who are living through end of empire have no idea that they're living through\nthe end of the empire. And I actually think about\nthat a lot from, you know, \"Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire\" by Edward Gibbon. Actually, your episode\non Rome was fantastic. People should go listen to that. So there you go. Another really good one. I like to think a lot\nabout the British Empire and if what eventually\nled to that collapse, and nobody in 1919 said the\nBritish Empires just collapsed, basically, nobody still thought that. They were like, yeah, the\nfirst World War is horrible. But actually, we came out of\nthis okay, we still have India, you know, we still have\nall these African colonies and all that, but you know,\nlong periods of servitude of debt to the United\nStates of degradation, of social upheaval, of bolshevism, of American industrial might. And next thing you know, you find yourself at Potsdam and Churchill's like, \"Holy shit, I have barely any power\nin this room,\" right? So it revolutions happened\nslowly and then all at once. And so could you really put a, you know, a real like pin in the\nend of the British Empire? It took almost 40 years for it to end. So America's empire will eventually end either from rising\ngeopolitical competition, likely China, could be\nIndia, nobody knows. It will likely be because\nof being overstretched of an elite capture is\nusually the reason why. And a misreading of what made\nyour original society work, you know, in the first place. And that is one where I honestly, like all three of those things\nwill happen all at once. And it will happen over an\nextremely long period of time. And it's very difficult to predict. I would not bet against America right now. I think we have a lot of\nfundamental strengths. It's such a unique and dynamic country. It really is fucking crazy. Every time I travel the world, as much as I love all these\ndifferent places I go, man, I just, I love the\nUnited States so much. You'll love it more when you leave. I really, I really believe that so. - Yeah, and it's nice to remember how quickly the public opinion shifts. Like we're very dynamic and\nadaptable, which, and annoys me. I understand that's part\nof the political discourse, saying like, if Trump wins,\nit's the end of America. If Kamala wins, it's the end of America. - So stupid. Yeah.\n- But I, I understand that the radical nature of that discourse is necessary to, like who mentioned- - Yeah, to drive out votes.\n- To drive up votes. - I like to think about Americans in 1866. I cannot imagine going through\na war where some x percent, I think it was like 2 or 3% or whatever, the entire population was just killed. Our president, who was\nthis visionary genius who were blessed to have, is assassinated at Forks Theater immediately after the surrender of Lee. Andrew Johnson, who's a bumbling, like fucktard is the one who is in charge. And you know, we are having\nall these insane crises over like internal management while we're also trying to decide like this new order in the South and whether to bring these people, how to bring these people\nback into the union. I mean, I would've\ndespaired like in that year, I've like, it's over, this is it. You know the war, I'd be\nlike, was it worth anything? You know, if Andrew Johnson\nis gonna be doing this, or even in the South, I\nmean, I can't even imagine for what they were going through too. You know, they have to go home and their entire cities\nare burned to the ground and they're trying to readjust and you know, their entire, economy and way of life is\noverthrown in five years. I mean, that's an insane time to be alive. And what do we know? It worked out, you know, by 1890s or so, there were people shaking\nhands, you know, union. And there's a cool video\non YouTube actually of FDR who is addressing some of\nthe last Gettysburg veterans, I think it was like the 75th\nanniversary or whatever. And you can literally see these old men who are shaking hands\nacross the stone wall. It gives me hope. Yeah. - Let's linger on that hope. What is the source of optimism you have for the 21st century, for the century beyond that, for human civilization\nin general is, you know, it's easy to learn cynical\nlessons from history, right? That shit eventually goes wrong, but sometimes it doesn't. So what gives you hope? - I think that the fundamentals of what makes humanity great and has for a long time are best expressed in the American character. And that despite all of our problems, that as a country with our ethos, a lot of the stuff we talked about today, individualism, the frontier mindset, the blessings of geography, the blessings of our economy, of the way that we're\nable to just incorporate different cultures and the best of each and put them all together, give us the best opportunity to succeed and to accomplish awesome things. We're the country that\nput a man on the moon, which is the epitome of the human spirit. I hope to see more of that. And you know, I think last\ntime I was here I shouted out, and I love Antarctic exploration. I've read basically every book that there is on the\nexploration of Antarctica. And one of the reasons I\nlove to do so is because there is no reason to\ncare about Antarctica. None, there's nothing down there. Zero. Going to the South Pole is\na truly useless exercise. And yet, we went, we went twice, actually\ntwo people went there in the span of five weeks\nand they competed to do so. - Yeah.\n- And the spirit that propelled Amundsen\nand Scott's expedition and people like Shackleton who's like, if you were to ask me\nmy hero of all heroes, it's Ernest Shackleton\nis because his spirit, I think lives on in the United States. It unfortunately died in Great Britain. And interestingly enough, the\nBrits even understand that. They're like, \"It's very interesting how popular Shackleton is in America.\" And even though he was Irish and he was a British subject, to me, he's a spiritual American. And I think that his\nspirit lives on within us and has always been here\nto a certain extent. And everywhere else, I think it's dying. But here, I love it here, there's so many cool things about America. People move around all the time. They buy new houses, they start families. There's no other place you\ncan just reset your whole life in the same country, it's wild. You can reinvent yourself. You can go broke, you can get rich, you can go back and forth multiple times and there's nobody there and there's nowhere else\nwhere you have enough freedom and opportunity to pursue that. I definitely have a lot of problems, but I've traveled enough\nof the world now to know that it's a special place and\nthat gives me a lot of hope. - I wish I could do a Bostonian accent of we do these things. - Yeah.\n- Not because they're easy, but 'cause they're hard. - Because they're hard.\n- Thank you. - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) - That's so true. The Scot-Irish guts.\n- Yeah. - Well, listen, I'm a\nhuge fan of yours, Saagar. I hope to see you in the White House\ninterviewing the president. - Yeah, there you go. That's right. That's the only situation you're gonna see me in the White House. - Yeah. (chuckles)\n- Yeah. - Front row and just talking free. I would just, I would love to live in\na country and in a world where it's you who gets to talk to the press secretary, to the president, 'cause I think you're real, you're one of the good ones\nas far as journalists goes, as far as human beings. So I hope to see you in there and I hope you get to ask a question that- - It ends up in a book. - It ends up in a good history book. - Absolutely, well, likewise, I'm a huge fan of yours. For anybody out there who's interested, I compiled a list and I will\ngo and retroactively edit it. Just go to SaagarEnjeti.io. I created a newsletter with a\nwebsite that has all the links to all the books I'm\ngonna talk about here. - Beautiful, the hundreds of\nbooks that were mentioned here. All right, brother, thank you\nso much for talking today. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Saagar Enjeti.
