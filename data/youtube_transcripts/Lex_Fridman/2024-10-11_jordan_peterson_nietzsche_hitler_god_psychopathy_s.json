  "full_text": "- The following is a conversation\nwith Jordan Peterson, his second time on this,\n\"The Lex Fridman Podcast.\" You have given a set of\nlectures on Nietzsche as part of the new Peterson Academy,\nand the lectures were powerful. There's some element of the\ncontradictions, the tensions, the drama, the way you\nlike, lock in on an idea, but then are struggling\nwith that idea, all of that, that feels like it's a Nietzschean. - Yeah, well, he's a big\ninfluence on me stylistically and like in terms of the\nway I approached writing. And also many of the people\nthat were other influences of mine were very influenced by him. So I was blown away when I\nfirst came across his writings. They're so intellectually dense that I don't know if there's anything that approximates that, Dostoevsky maybe, although\nhe's much more wordy. Nietzsche is very succinct,\npartly 'cause he was so (indistinct) 'cause\nhe would think all day, he couldn't spend a lot of time writing. And he condenses writings into very short, well this aphoristic style he had. And it's really something to strive for. And then he's also an exciting\nwriter like Dostoevsky and dynamic and romantic\nin that emotional way. And so it's really something, and I really enjoyed doing that. I did that lecture that you described, that lecture series is on the first half of \"Beyond Good and Evil,\"\nwhich is a stunning book. And that was really fun\nto take pieces of it and then to describe what they mean and how they've echoed across the decades since he wrote them. And yeah, it's been great. - Taking each sentence seriously and deconstructing it and\nreally struggling with it. I think underpinning that approach to writing requires deep\nrespect for the person. I think if we approach writing\nwith that kind of respect, you can take Orwell, you\ncan take a lot of writers and really dig in on singular sentences. - Yeah, well those are the great writers because the greatest writers, virtually everything they\nwrote is worth attending to. And I think Nietzsche is in some ways the ultimate exemplar of that. Because often when I read a book, I'll mark one way or another, I often fold the corner of the page over to indicate something that I've found that's worth remembering. I couldn't do that with a book\nlike \"Beyond Good and Evil\" because every page ends up marked. And that's in marked\ncontrast, so to speak, to many of the books I read now where it's quite frequently\nnow that I'll read a book and there won't be an idea in it that I haven't come across before. And with a thinker like Nietzsche, that's just not the case\nat the sentence level. And I don't think there's anyone\nthat I know of who did that to a greater extent than he did. So there's other people whose thought is of equivalent value. I've returned recently and I'm going to do a\ncourse on to the work of this Romanian historian\nof religions, Mircea Eliade who's not nearly as well\nknown as he should be, and whose work, by the\nway, is a real antidote to the postmodern\nnihilistic Marxist stream of literary interpretation\nthat the universities as a whole have adopted. And Eliade is like that too. I used this book called\n\"The Sacred and the Profane\" quite extensively in a book that I'm releasing in mid-November. \"We Who Wrestle With God\"\nand it's of the same sort. It's endlessly analyzable. Eliade walked through the whole history of religious ideas. And he had the intellect\nthat enabled him to do that. And everything he wrote is\ndreamlike in its density. So every sentence or\nparagraph is evocative in an image rich manner. And that also, what would you say, deepens and broadens the scope. And that's part of often\nwhat distinguishes writing that has a literary end from writing that's more merely technical. Like the literary writings\nhave this imagistic and dreamlike reference space around them. And it takes a long time to turn a complex image\ninto something semantic. And so if your writing\nevokes deep imagery, it has a depth that can't\nbe captured merely in words. And the great romantic\npoetic philosophers, Nietzsche is a very good example. Dostoevsky's a good example. So is Mircea Eliade,\nthey have that quality. And it's a good way of thinking about it. You know, it's kind of\ninteresting from the perspective of technical analysis of intelligence, and there's a good book\ncalled \"The User Illusion,\" which is the best book on\nconsciousness that I ever read. It explains the manner in which our communication is\nunderstandable in this manner. So imagine that when you're\ncommunicating something, you're trying to change the way that your target audience\nperceives and acts in the world. So that's an embodied issue. But you're using words which aren't, obviously aren't equivalent\nto the actions themselves. You can imagine that the words\nare surrounded by a cloud of images that they evoke and that the images can be\ntranslated into actions. And the greatest writing uses words in a manner that evokes images, that profoundly affects\nperception and action. And that's the, so I would take the manner\nin which I act and behave. I would translate that\ninto a set of images. My dreams do that for me, for example. Then I compress them into words. I toss you the words, you decompose them, decompress them into the images\nand then into the actions. And that's what happens in\na meaningful conversation. It's a very good way of understanding how we communicate linguistically. - So if the words spring to the visual, full visual complexity and then that can then transform itself into action. - And change in perception.\n- Change in perception. - Well those are both relevant and it's an important thing to understand because the classic empiricists\nmake the presumption, and it's an erroneous presumption, that perception is a\nvalue free enterprise. And they assume that partly because they think of\nperception as something passive. You know, you just turn your head and you look at the world and there it is. It's like perception is not passive. There is no perception\nwithout action, ever, ever. And that's a weird thing to understand because even when you're looking\nat something like your eyes are moving back and forth,\nif they ever stop moving for a 10th of a second,\nyou stop being able to see. So your eyes are jiggling back and forth, just to keep them active. And then there's involuntary\nmovements of your eyes, and then there's voluntary\nmovements of your eyes. Like what you're doing with\nyour eyes is very much like what a blind person would\ndo if they were feeling out the contours of a object. You're sampling and you're only sampling a small element of the space\nthat's in front of you. And the element that you choose to sample is dependent on\nyour aims and your goals. So it's value saturated. And so all your perceptions\nare action predicated. And partly what you're doing\nwhen you're communicating is therefore not only changing\npeople's actions, let's say, but you're also changing the strategy that they use to perceive. And so you change the way the\nworld reveals itself for them. See, this is why it's\nsuch a profound experience to read a particularly deep thinker because you could also\nthink of your perceptions as the axioms of your thought. That's a good way of thinking about it. A perception is like\na, what would you say? It's a thought that's so set in concrete that you now see it rather\nthan conceptualize it. A really profound thinker changes the way you perceive the world. That's way deeper than\njust how you think about it or how you feel about it. - What about not just profound thinkers, but thinkers that deliver a powerful idea? For example, utopian ideas of Marx or utopian ideas, you could\nsay dystopian ideas of Hitler. Those ideas are powerful and they can saturate all\nyour perception with values and they focus you in a way where there's only a\ncertain set of actions. - Yeah, right, even a certain\nset of emotions as well. - And it's intense and it's direct and they're so powerful that they completely alter the perception and the words spring to life. - Yeah, it's like a form of possession. So there's two things\nyou need to understand to make that clear. The first issue is that,\nas we suggested or implied, that perception is action predicated, but action is goal predicated, right? The act towards goal. And these propagandistic\nthinkers that you described, they attempt to unify all possible goals into a coherent singularity. And there's advantages of that. There's the advantage of\nsimplicity, for example, which is a major advantage. And there's also the advantage\nof motivation, right? So if you provide people\nwith a simple manner of integrating all their actions,\nyou decrease their anxiety and you increase their motivation. That can be a good thing\nif the unifying idea that you've put forward is valid. But it's the worst of all possible ideas, if you put forward an\ninvalid, unifying idea, and then you might say,\nwell, how do you distinguish between a valid unifying idea\nand an invalid, unifying idea? Now Nietzsche was very interested in that and I don't think he\ngot that exactly right. But the postmodernists for\nexample, especially the ones, and this is most of them\nwith the neo-Marxist bent, their presumption is that the fundamental\nunifying idea is power. That everything's about\ncompulsion and force essentially. And that that's the only true\nunifying ethos of mankind, which is, I don't know if\nthere's a worse idea than that. I mean there are ideas that\nare potentially as dangerous. The nihilistic idea is pretty dangerous, although it's more of\na disintegrating notion than a unifying idea. The hedonistic idea that you\nlive for pleasure for example, that's also very dangerous. But if you wanted to\ngo for sheer pathology, the notion that, and this\nis Foucault in a nutshell, and Marx for that matter,\nthat power rules everything. Not only is that a terrible unifying idea, but it fully justifies\nyour own use of power. And I don't mean the power\nNietzsche talks about, his will to power was more his insistence that a human being is\nan expression of will rather than a mechanism of\nself-protection and security. Like he thought of the\nlife force in human beings as something that strived\nnot to protect itself, but to exhaust itself\nin being and becoming. It's like an upward\noriented motivational drive even towards meaning, now he\ncalled it the will to power. And that had some\nunfortunate consequences. At least that's how it's translated. But he didn't mean the power motivation that people like Foucault or\nMarx became so hung up on. - So it's not power like you're\ntrying to destroy the other, it's power full flourishing\nof a human being, the creative force of a\nhuman being in that way. - Yeah, well you could imagine that and you should, you could imagine that you could segregate\ncompetence and ability, like imagine that you and I were going to work on a project, we could organize our\nproject in relationship to the ambition that we wanted to attain. And we can organize an agreement\nso that you were committed to the project voluntarily. And so that I was committed\nto the project voluntarily. So that means that we\nwould actually be united in our perceptions and our\nactions by the motivation of something approximating voluntary play. Now you could also imagine\nanother situation where I said, here's our goal and you better help me, or I'm gonna kill your family. Well, the probability is that you would be quite motivated to undertake my bidding. And so then you might say, well\nthat's how the world works. It's power and compulsion. But the truth of the matter\nis that you can force people to see things your way, let's say, but it's nowhere near as good a strategy, even practically than the strategy that would be associated with\nsomething like voluntary, voluntary joint agreement of pattern of movement strategy towards a goal. See, this is such an important\nthing to understand because it helps you start to understand the distinction\nbetween a unifying force that's based on power and compulsion and one that is much more\nin keeping, I would say with the ethos that\ngoverns Western societies, free Western societies. There's really a qualitative difference and it's not some morally\nrelativistic illusion. - So if we just look at the\nnuance of Nietzsche's thought, the idea he first introduced in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\"\nof the Ubermensch. That's another one that's\nvery easy to misinterpret because it sounds awfully a\nlot like it's about power. - Yeah, right.\n- For example, in the 20th century it was misrepresented and co-opted by Hitler to\nadvocate for the extermination of the inferior non-Aryan races. - Yeah, and the dominion\nof the superior Aryans. And yeah, well, and that was partly because Nietzsche's work\nalso was misrepresented by his sister after his death. But I also think that there's a fundamental flaw in that Nietzschean conceptualization. So Nietzsche of course famously\nannounced the death of God, but he did that in a\nmanner that was accompanied by dire warnings like Nietzsche said, because people tend to think of that as a triumphalist statement. But Nietzsche actually said that, he really said something like, the unifying ethos under which\nwe've organized ourselves psychologically and socially\nhas now been fatally undermined by, well by the rationalist proclivity, by the empiricist proclivity. There's a variety of reasons. Mostly it was conflict between\nthe enlightenment view, let's say, and the classic religious view and that there will be\ndire consequences for that. And Nietzsche knew, like\nDostoevsky knew that, see, there's a proclivity\nfor the human psyche and for human societies to move towards something\napproximating a unity because the cost of disunity is high, fractionation of your goals. So that means you're less motivated to move forward than you might be 'cause there's many things\ncompeting for your attention. And also anxiety, because anxiety actually signals something like goal conflict. So there's an inescapable proclivity of value systems to unite. Now if you kill the thing\nthat's uniting them, that's the death of God, they either fractionate\nand you get confusion, anxiety and hopelessness,\nor you get social disunity and you get social disunity or something else arises out of the abyss to constitute that unifying force. And Nietzsche said specifically\nthat he believed that one of those manifestations\nwould be that of communism and that that would kill, he\nsaid this in will to power, that that would kill tens of millions of people in the upcoming 20th century. He could see that coming 50 years earlier. And Dostoevsky did the same\nthing in his book, \"Demons.\" And so this is the thing that the areligious have to contend with. It's a real conundrum because I mean, you could dispute the idea that our value systems\ntend towards a unity and society does as well 'cause otherwise we're disunified. But the cost of that disunity, as I said, is goal confusion,\nanxiety, and hopelessness. So it's like a real cost. So you could dispense with the\nnotion of unity altogether. And the postmodernists\ndid that to some degree, but they pulled off a slight of hand too, where they replaced it by power. Now Nietzsche did, he's\nresponsible for that to some degree because Nietzsche said, with\nhis conception of the Uberman, let's say, is that human beings would have to create their own values\nbecause the value structure that had descended from on\nhigh was now shunted aside. But there's a major problem\nwith that, many major problems. The psychoanalysts were the first people who really figured this\nout after Nietzsche, because imagine that we\ndon't have a relationship with the transcendental anymore. That orients us, okay, now\nwe have to turn to ourselves. Okay, now, if we were a unity, a clear unity within ourselves, let's say, then we could turn to\nourselves for that discovery. But if we're a fractionated\nplurality internally, then when we turn to ourselves, we turn to a fractionated plurality. Well, that was Freud's observation. It's like, well, how can you make your own\nvalues when you're not the master in your own house? Like you're a war of\ncompeting motivations, or maybe you're someone\nwho's dominated by the will to force and compulsion. And so why do you think that\nyou can rely on yourself as the source of values? And why do you think you're\nwise enough to consult with yourself to find\nout what those values are or what they should be say in\nthe course of a single life? I mean, you know, it's difficult to organize your own\npersonal relationship, like one relationship in\nthe course of your life, let alone to try to imagine that out of whole cloth you\ncould construct an ethos that would be psychologically\nand socially stabilizing and last over the long run. It's like, and of course\nMarx, people like that, the people who reduce human motivation to a single axis, they had\nthe intellectual hubris to imagine that they could do that. Postmodernists are a good\nexample of that as well. - Okay, but if we lay on the table, religion, communism, nazism, they are all unifying ethos. They're unifying ideas, but they're also horribly dividing ideas. They both unify and divide. Religion has also divided people 'cause in the nuances of how the different peoples wrestle with God, they have come to different conclusions and then they use those conclusions that perhaps the people in\npower use those conclusions to then start wars, to\nstart hatred, to divide. - Yeah, well, it's one\nof the key sub-themes in the gospels is the sub\ntheme of the Pharisees. And so the fundamental enemies of Christ in the gospels are the Pharisees and the scribes and the lawyers. So what does that mean? The Pharisees are religious hypocrites. The scribes are academics who\nworship their own intellect. And the lawyers are the legal minds who use the law as a weapon. And so they're the enemy of the redeemer. That's a subplot in the gospel stories. And that actually all means something. The pharisaic problem is that the best of all possible ideas can be used by the worst actors in\nthe worst possible way. And maybe this is an\nexistential conundrum, is that the most evil people\nuse the best possible ideas to the worst possible ends. And then you have the conundrum\nof how do you separate out, let's say, the genuine religious people from those who use the\nreligious enterprise only for their own machinations. We're seeing this happen online. Like one of the things that\nyou're seeing happening online, I'm sure you've noticed this, especially on the right wing troll side, right wing psychopathic troll side of the distribution is the\nweaponization of a certain form of Christian ideation. And that's often marked at\nleast online by the presence of, what would you say cliches\nlike Christ is king, which has a certain religious meaning, but a completely different\nmeaning in this sphere of emerging right wing\npathology, right wing, the political dimension\nisn't the right dimension of analysis, but it's definitely the case that the best possible ideas can be used for the worst possible purposes. And that also brings up\nanother specter, which is like, well, is there any reliable and valid way of distinguishing\ntruly beneficial, unifying ideas from those\nthat are pathological? And so that's another thing that I tried to detail out in these lectures, but also in this new book is like, how do you tell the good\nactors from the bad actors at the most fundamental level of analysis? - And good ideas from the bad ideas, and you lecture on truth that\nNietzsche also struggled with, so how do you know, how do you know that\ncommunism is a bad idea versus it's a good idea\nimplemented by bad actors? - Right, right, that's\na more subtle variant of the religious problem. And that's what the\ncommunists say all the time. The modern day communists, like real communism has never been tried. And you could say, I suppose\nwith some justification, you could say that real\nChristianity has never been tried because we always fall\nshort of the ideal mark. And so, I mean, my rejoinder to the communists is something\nlike every single time it's been implemented, wherever it's been implemented, regardless of the culture\nand the background of the people who've implemented it, it's had exactly the same\ncatastrophic consequences. It's like, I don't know how\nmany examples you need of that, but I believe we've\ngenerated sufficient examples so that case is basically resolved. Now, the general rejoinder to that is, hmm, it's really something like, well, if I was in charge of\nthe communist enterprise, the utopia would've come about, right? But that's also a form\nof dangerous pretense. Part of the way, see, that\nproblem is actually resolved to some degree in the notion of, in the developing notion of sacrifice that emerges in the western\ncanon over thousands and thousands of years. So one of the suggestions, for example, and this is something\nexemplified in the passion story, is that you can tell the\nvalid holder of an idea because that holder will\ntake the responsibility for the consequences of\nhis idea onto himself. And that's why, for\nexample, you see one way of conceptualizing Christ\nin the gospel story is as the ultimate sacrifice to God. So you might ask, well,\nwhat's the ultimate sacrifice? And there are variance\nof the answer to that. One form of ultimate sacrifice\nis the sacrifice of a child, the offering of a child, and the other is the offering of the self. And the story of Christ\nbrings both of those together because he's the son of\nGod, that's offered to God. And so it's an archetypal\nresolution of that tension between ultimate sacrifice, ultimate because once you're a parent, most parents would rather\nsacrifice themselves than their children, right? So you have something that becomes of even more value than\nyourself, but the sacrifice of self is also a very high\norder level of sacrifice. Christ is an archetype\nof the pattern of being that's predicated on the decision to take, to offer everything up to\nthe highest value, right? That pattern of self-sacrifice. And I think part of the\nreason that's valid is because the person who undertakes to do that pays the price themself. It's not externalized, they're not trying to change anyone else\nexcept maybe by example. It's your problem. And like, Solzhenitsyn\npointed that out too when he was struggling with\nthe idea of good versus evil. And you see this in more\nsophisticated literature, you know, in really unsophisticated\nliterature or drama, there's a good guy and the bad guy and the good guy's all good,\nand the bad guy's all bad. And in more sophisticated literature, the good and bad are abstracted. You can think of them as spirits. And then those spirits\npossess all the characters in the complex drama to a\ngreater or lesser degree. And that battle is fought out\nboth socially and internally. In the high order religious\nconceptualizations in the west, if they culminate, let's\nsay in the Christian story, the notion is that battle between good and evil is fundamentally\nplayed out as an internal drama. - Yeah, so for a religious\nethos, the battle between good and evil is fought within\neach individual human heart? - Right, it's your moral duty to constrain evil within yourself. And while there's more to it than that, because there's also the\ninsistence that if you do that, that makes you the most effective possible like warrior, let's say, against evil itself in the\nsocial world, that you start with the battle that occurs\nwithin you in the soul, let's say, the soul\nbecomes the battleground between the forces of good and evil. The idea that there's an idea there too, which is if that battle is\nundertaken successfully, then it doesn't have to be\nplayed out in the social world as actual conflict, right? You can rectify the conflict\ninternally without it having to be played out as fate, as Jung put it. - So what would you say to Nietzsche who called Christianity\nthe slave morality? And his critique of religion in that way was slave morality\nversus master morality. And then you put an Ubermensch into that. - Well, that's that, see, I would say that the woke phenomenon\nis the manifestation of the slave morality\nthat Nietzsche criticized, and that there are\nelements of Christianity that can be gerrymandered to support that mode of perception and conception. But I think he was wrong and he was wrong in\nhis essential criticism of Christianity in that regard. Now, it's complicated with Nietzsche because Nietzsche never criticizes the gospel stories directly. What he basically criticizes is something like the pathologies of\ninstitutionalized religion. And I would say most particularly of the, what would you say, of the sort of casually\ntoo nice Protestant form, you know, that's a thumbnail sketch and perhaps somewhat unfair, but given the alignment, let's say, of the more mainstream\nProtestant movements with the woke mob, I don't\nthink it's an absurd criticism. And it's something like the degeneration of Christianity into the notion that good and harmless are the same thing, or good and empathic are the same thing, which is simply not true\nand far too simplified. And I also think Nietzsche\nwas extremely wrong in his presumption that\nhuman beings should take it to themselves to construct\ntheir own values. I think he made a colossal\nerror in that presumption. - And that is the idea of the Ubermensch, that the great individual, the best of us, should create our own values. - Well, and I think the\nreason that he was wrong about that is that, so when\nGod gives instructions to Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden, he basically tells them that they can do anything they\nwant in the walled garden. So that's the kind of\nbalance between order and nature that makes up\nthe human environment. Human beings have the freedom, vouch safe to them by God to do anything they want in the garden, except to mess with the\nmost fundamental rule. So God says to people, you're\nnot to eat of the fruit of the tree, of the\nknowledge of good and evil, which fundamentally means there is an implicit moral\norder, and you're to abide by it. Your freedom stops at the foundation. And you can think about that. I'd be interested even\nin your ideas about this as an engineer, let's say, is that, there is an ethos that's\nimplicit in being itself, and your ethos has to\nbe a reflection of that. And that isn't under your control. You can't gerrymander the foundation because your foundational beliefs have to put you in harmony,\nlike musical harmony with the actual structure\nof reality as such. So I can give you an example of that. So our goal insofar as we're\nconducting ourselves properly, is to have the kind of\ninteresting conversation that allows both of us to\nexpress ourself in a manner that enables us to learn and grow such that we can share that with everyone who's listening. And if our aim is true and upward, then that's what we're doing, well, that means that we're\ngoing to have to match ourselves to a pattern of interaction. And that's marked for us emotionally. Like you and I both know this,\nif we're doing this right, we're gonna be interested\nin the conversation. We're not gonna be looking at our watch, we're not gonna be thinking\nabout what we're aiming at, we're just gonna communicate. Now, the religious\ninterpretation of that would be that we were doing something like making the redemptive logos manifest\nbetween us in dialogue. And that's something that can be shared. To do that, we have to\nalign with that pattern. I can't decide that\nthere's some arbitrary way that I'm gonna play you. I mean, I could do that if I\nwas a psychopathic manipulator, but to do that optimally, I'm not going to impose a certain mode of, a certain a priori aim, let's say, on our communication and\nmanipulate you into that. So the constraints on my ethos reflect the actual structure of the world. And I can't, this is the\ncommunist presumption. It's like we're gonna burn everything down and we're gonna start from scratch, and we've got these\naxiomatic presumptions, and we're gonna put them into place and we're gonna socialize people. So they now think and live\nlike communists from day one. And human beings are infinitely malleable, and we can use a rational set\nof presuppositions to decide what sort of beings they should be. The transhumanists are doing this too. It's like, no, there's a pattern of being that you have to fall into alignment with. And I think it's the\npattern of being by the way, that if you fall into alignment\nwith it gives you hope. It protects you from anxiety and it gives you a sense of harmony with your surroundings\nand with other people. And none of that's arbitrary. - But don't you think we both\narrived to this conversation with rigid axioms that we have,\nmaybe we're blind to them, but in the same way that the Marxist came with very rigid axioms\nabout the way the world is and the way it should be. Aren't we coming to that? - Well, we definitely\ncome to the conversation with a hierarchy of\nfoundational axioms, right? And I would say the more\nsophisticated you are as a thinker, the deeper the level at\nwhich you're willing to play. So imagine first that\nyou have presumptions of different depth. There's more predicated on\nthe more fundamental axioms. And then that there's a\nspace of play around those. And that space of play is going to depend on the sophistication\nof the player, obviously. But those who are capable of engaging in deeper conversations talk about more fundamental\nthings with more play. Now, we have to come to the conversation with a certain degree of structure, because we wouldn't be able\nto understand each other or communicate if a lot of\nthings weren't already assumed or taken for granted. - How rigid is the hierarchy of axioms that religion provides? This is what I'm trying to understand, the rigidity of that hierarchy. - It's rigid as play. - Well, play is not rigid at all. - No, no, no, no, no, no, it's gotta be. - There's some constraints. - It took me about 40 years to figure out the answer to that question. So it wasn't, I'm serious about that. So it wasn't a random answer. So play is very rigid in some ways. So like, if you and I go out\nto play basketball or chess, like there are rules and\nyou can't break the rules because then you're no longer in the game. But then there's a dynamism\nwithin those rules that's, well, with chess, it's virtually infinite. I mean, I think, what is\nit, there's more patterns of potential games on a chess board than there are subatomic particles in the observable universe. Like it's an insane space. So it's not like there's\nnot freedom within it, but it's a weird paradox\nin a way, isn't it? Because music is like this too, is that there are definitely rules. And there are things, you can't throw a basketball\ninto a chess board and still be playing chess. But weirdly enough, if\nyou adhere to the rules, the realm of freedom increases\nrather than decreasing. And I think you can make the same case for a playful conversation. It's like we're playing by certain rules, and a lot of them are implicit, but that doesn't mean that, it might mean the reverse\nof constraint, you know? Because in this seminar, for example, that I was referring\nto, the Exodus seminar and then the gospel seminar,\neverybody in this seminar, there's about eight of us, played fair. Nobody used power. Nobody tried to prove they were right. They put forward their points, but they were like, here's\na way of looking at that, assess it. And they were also doing it genuinely. It's like, this is what I've\nconcluded about say this story and I'm gonna make a case for it, but I'd like to hear what you have to say because maybe you can change\nit, you can extend it, you can find a flaw in it. And that's, well, that's a\nconversation that has flow and that's engaging and that other people\nwill listen to as well. And that's also a, see, I\nthink that one of the things that we can conclude now, and we can do this even from\na neuroscientific basis, is that that's sense of engaged\nmeaning is a marker not only for the emergence of harmony between you and your environment,\nbut for the emergence of that harmony in a way\nthat is developmentally rich, that moves you upward\ntowards, what would you say? Well, I think towards a more\neffective entropic state, that's actually the\ntechnical answer to that. But it makes you more than you are, and there's a directionality in that. - Well, I would like to sort of, the reason I like talking about communism, because it has clearly been\nshown as a set of ideas to be destructive to humanity. But I would like to understand from an\nengineering perspective, the characteristics of\ncommunism versus religion, where you could identify\nreligious thought is going to lead to a better human being, a better society. And communist Marxist thought is not. - [Jordan] Yeah, right. - Because there's ambiguity, there's room for play in communism and Marxism because they kind of\nhad a utopian sense of where everybody's headed, don't\nknow how it's gonna happen. Maybe revolution is required, but after the revolution is\ndone, we'll figure it out. And there's an underlying assumption that maybe human beings are good and they'll figure it out\nonce you remove the oppressor. I mean all these ideas kind of, until you put 'em into\npractice, you could, they can be quite convincing, if you were in the 19th century. If I was reading, which\nis kind of fascinating, the 19th century produced\nsuch powerful ideas, Marx and Nietzsche. - Oh, fascism too, for that matter. - Fascism, so, you know,\nif I was sitting there, like, especially if I'm\nfeeling shitty about myself, a lot of these ideas are pretty powerful as a way to plug the nihilist hole. - Yeah, right, absolutely. Well, and some of them may actually have an appropriate scope of application. It could be that some of\nthe foundational axioms of communism, socialism slash communism\nare actually functional in a sufficiently small social group, maybe a tribal group even. Like I also have a, I'm\nnot sure this is correct, but I have a suspicion that\nthe pervasive attractiveness of some of the radical left ideas that we're talking about\nare pervasive precisely because they are functional\nwithin, say, families, but also within the small tribal groups that people might have\noriginally evolved into. And that once we become civilized, so we produce societies that\nare united, even among people who don't know one another,\ndifferent principles have to apply as a consequence of scale. So that's partly an engineering response, but I think there's a\nmore, a deeper way of going after the communist problem. So I think part of the\ncommunist, the problem, fundamental problem with the\ncommunist axioms is the notion that the world of complex social\ninteractions can be simplified sufficiently so that\ncentralized planning authorities can deal with it. And I think the best way to think about the free exchange rejoinder to that presumption is no, the sum total of human interactions in a large\ncivilization are so immense that you need a distributed\nnetwork of cognition in order to compute\nthe proper way forward. And so what you do is you\ngive each actor their domain of individual choice so that they can maximize\ntheir own movement forward. And you allow the aggregate direction to emerge from that rather than trying to\nimpose it from the top down, which I think is\ncomputationally impossible. So that might be one engineering reason why the communist solution doesn't work. Like I read in Solzhenitsyn, for example, that the central Soviet\nauthorities often had to make 200 pricing decisions a day. Now, if you've ever started a\nbusiness or created a product and had to wrestle with\nthe problem of pricing, you'd become aware of just\nhow intractable that is. Like how do you calculate worth? Well, there's the central\nexistential problem of life. How do you calculate worth? It's not something like a\ncentral authority can sit down and just manage. And there is a lot of inputs that go into a pricing decision. And the free market answer\nto that is something like, well, if you get the price right, people will buy it and you'll survive. - This is a fascinating way\nto describe how ideas fail. So communism perhaps fails because just like what people\nbelieve the earth is flat, when you look outside, it looks flat, but you can't see beyond\nthe horizon, I guess. So in the same way with communism, communism seems like a\ngreat idea in my family and my people I love,\nbut it doesn't scale. - And it doesn't iterate. And that's a form scaling of too. - Well, I mean, whatever\nways it breaks down, it doesn't scale. And you're saying religious thought is a thing that might scale. - I would say religious thought\nis the record of those ideas that have in fact scaled, right. - In theory.\n- And iterated. - Does religious thought iterate? So I mean, there's a\nfundamental conservative aspect to religious thought, tradition. - This is why I like\nMircea Eliade, for example, who I referred to earlier,\none of the things Eliade did and very effectively, and\npeople like Joseph Campbell, who in some ways were popularizer of Eliade's ideas, and Carl Jung's, what they really did was devote themselves to an analysis of those ideas that scaled and iterated across the\nlargest possible spans of time. And so Eliade and Jung, Erich\nNeumann, they were looking, and Campbell, they were looking\nat patterns of narrative that were common across\nreligious traditions that had spanned millennia\nand found many patterns. The hero's myth, for example,\nis one of those patterns, and it's, I think the evidence that it has its reflection\nin human neurophysiology and neuropsychology is incontrovertible. And so these foundational\nnarratives, they last, they're common across\nmultiple religious traditions. They unite, they work psychologically, but they also reflect the underlying\nneurophysiological architecture. So I can give you an example of that. So the hero myth is really a quest myth. And a quest myth is really\na story of exploration and expansion of adaptation, right? So Bilbo the Hobbit, he's a\nkind of an ordinary everyman. He lives in a very constrained\nand orderly and secure world. And then the quest call\ncomes and he goes out and he expands his personality\nand develops his wisdom. And that's reflected in human neuropsychological architecture at a very low level, way below cognition. So one of the most fundamental elements of the mammalian brain, and even in lower animal\nforms, is the hypothalamus. It's sort of the root\nof primary motivation. So it governs lust and it\nregulates your breathing, and it regulates your hunger,\nand it regulates your thirst and it regulates your temperature. Like really low level\nbiological necessities are regulated by the hypothalamus. When you get hungry,\nit's the hypothalamus. When you're activated in a\ndefensively aggressive manner, that's the hypothalamus. Half the hypothalamus is the origin of the dopaminergic tracts,\nand they subsume exploration. And so you could think of the\nhuman motivational reality as a domain that's governed by axiomatic motivational states, love, sex, defensive aggression, hunger, and another domain that's\ngoverned by exploration. And the rule would be something like when your basic motivational\nstates are stated, explore, well, and then, and that's not cognitive, like I said, this is deep, deep brain architecture. It's extraordinarily ancient. And the exploration\nstory is something like go out into the unknown and take the risks because the information that you discover and the skills you\ndevelop will be worthwhile even in saving the basic\nmotivational drives. And then you wanna learn to\ndo that in a iterative manner. So it sustains across time,\nand you wanna do it in a way that unites you with other people. And there's a pattern to that. And I do think that's the\npattern that's we strive to encapsulate in our\ndeep religious narratives. And I think that in many ways\nwe've done that successfully. - What is the belief in God? How does that fit in? What does it mean to believe in God? - Okay, so in one of\nthe stories that I cover in \"We Who Wrestle With God,\"\nwhich I only recently begun to take apart say in the last two years, is the story of Abraham. And it's a very cool story, and it's also related by the way, to your question about\nwhat makes communism wrong. And Dostoevsky knew this, not\nprecisely the Abraham story, but the same reason. In \"Notes From Underground,\" Dostoevsky made a very\ntelling observation. So he speaks in the voice\nof a cynical nihilistic and bitter bureaucrat\nwho's been a failure, who's talking cynically about\nthe nature of human beings, but also very accurately. And one of the things he\npoints out with regards to modern utopianism is that human beings are\nvery strange creatures. And that if you gave them what\nthe socialist utopians want to give them, so let's say all\nyour needs are taken care of, all your material needs are taken care of, and even indefinitely,\nDostoevsky's claim was, you don't understand\nhuman beings very well, because if you put them\nin an environment that was that comfortable, they would\npurposefully go insane, just to break it into bits, just so something interesting\nwould happen, right? And he says it's the human proclivity to curse and complain. And he says this in quite\na cynic and caustic manner, but he's pointing to something deep, which is that we're not built\nfor comfort and security. We're not infants, we're\nnot after satiation. So then you might ask, well, what the hell are we after then? That's what the Abraham story addresses. And Abraham is the first true individual in the biblical narrative. So you could think about his\nstory as the archetypal story of the developing individual. So you said, well, what's God? Well, in the Abraham story,\nGod is characterized a lot of different ways in the\nclassic religious texts, like the Bible is actually a compilation of different characterizations\nof the divine with the insistence that they\nreflect an underlying unity. In the story of Abraham, the divine is the call to adventure. So Abraham has the\nsocialist utopia at hand. He's from a wealthy family,\nand he has everything he needs. And he actually doesn't do anything, until he is in his seventies. Now, hypothetically, people in those times lived much longer, but a voice comes to Abraham and it tells him something very specific. It says, leave your zone of comfort. Leave your parents, leave your\ntent, leave your community. Leave your tribe, leave your\nland, go out into the world. And Abraham thinks, well, why? I've got naked slave girls peeling grapes and feeding them to me, it's like, what do I need an adventure for? And God tells them, and this\nis the covenant, by the way, part of the covenant that the God of the Israelites makes with his people. It's very, very specific,\nit's very brilliant. He says, if you follow\nthe voice of adventure, you'll become a blessing to yourself. So that's a good deal\nbecause people generally live at odds with themselves. And he says, God says, that's not all. You'll become a blessing\nto yourself in a way that furthers your reputation among people and validly so that you'll\naccomplish things that were real, and people will know it,\nand you'll be held high in their esteem, and that will be valid. So that's a pretty good deal because social people\nwould like to be regarded as of utility and worth by others. And so that's a good deal. And God says, that's not all. You'll establish something of lasting permanent and deep value. And that's why Abraham\nbecomes the father of nations, and finally caps it off. And he says, there's a\nbetter element even to it. There's a capstone, you'll do all three of those things in a way that's maximally beneficial\nto everyone else. And so the divinity in the Abrahamic story is making a claim. He says, first of all, there's a drive that you should attend to,\nso the spirit of adventure that calls you out of\nyour zone of comfort. Now, if you attend to that and you make the sacrifices\nnecessary to follow that path, then the following benefits\nwill accrue to you. Your life will be a blessing. Everyone will hold you in high esteem. You'll establish something\nof permanent value, and you'll do it in a way that's maximally beneficial\nto everyone else. And so think about what\nthis means biologically or from an engineering standpoint. It means that the instinct to develop that characterizes outward\nmoving children, let's say, or adults, is the same\ninstinct that allows for psychological stability, that allows for movement upward in a social hierarchy, that establishes something iterable. And that does that in a manner\nthat allows everyone else to partake in the same process. Well, you know, that's a good deal. And like I can't see\nhow it cannot be true. Because the alternative hypothesis\nwould be that the spirit that moves you beyond yourself to develop, the spirit of a curious child, let's say, what is that antithetical to? Your own esteem? Is that antithetical to\nother people's best interest? Is it not the thing that\nincreases the probability that you'll do something permanent? That's a stupid theory. - So God is a call to adventure\nwith some constraints. - A call to true adventure.\n- To true adventure. - Yeah, and then that's a good observation because that begs the question, what constitutes the most true adventure? Well, that's not fully fleshed out until, at least from the Christian\nperspective, let's say, that's not fully fleshed\nout until the gospels because the passion of Christ is the, you could say this is the\nperfectly reasonable way of looking at it. The passion of Christ is the\ntruest adventure of Abraham. That's a terrible thing,\neh, because it's a, the passion story is a\ncatastrophic tragedy, although it obviously has\nits redemptive elements. But one of the things\nthat's implied there is that there's no distinction between\nthe true adventure of life and taking on the pathway of maximal responsibility and burden. And I can't see how that cannot be true. Like, 'cause the counter\nhypothesis is, well, Lex, the best thing for\nyou to do in your life is to shrink from all challenge and hide, right, to remain infantile,\nto remain secure. Not to ever push yourself\nbeyond your limits, not to take any risks. Well, no one thinks that's true. - So basically, the maximally\nworthwhile adventure could possibly be highly correlated with the hardest possible\navailable adventure. - The hardest possible available adventure voluntarily undertaken. - Does it have to be voluntary? - It has to be, absolutely. - How do you define voluntarily? - Well, here's an example of that. That's a good question too. When Christ is, the night\nbefore the crucifixion, which in principle he knows is coming, he asks God to relieve him of his burden. And understandably so. I mean, that's the scene\nfamously in which he's sweating, literally sweating blood\nbecause he knows what's coming. And the Romans designed crucifixion to be the most agonizing and humiliating possible,\nagonizing, humiliating, and disgusting possible death, right? So there is every reason to\nbe apprehensive about that. And you might say, well,\ncould you undertake that voluntarily as an adventure? And the answer to that is something like, well, what's your relationship with death? That's a problem you have to solve. And you could fight it and\nyou could be bitter about it. And there's reasons for that, especially if it's painful and degrading. But the alternative is something like, well, that's what's fleshed out\nin religious imagery always. It's very difficult to cast into words. It's like, no, you welcome the struggle. That's why I called the book\n\"We Who Wrestle With God,\" you welcome the struggle. And Lex, I don't see how\nyou can come to terms with life without construing\nit something like, construing it as something\nlike bring it on. Welcome the struggle. And I can't say that\nthere's a limit to that. It's like, well, I welcome the struggle until it gets difficult, well. - So there's not a bell curve like the struggle in moderation. Basically, you have to welcome\nwhatever as hard as it gets. And the crucifixion in\nthat way is a symbol. - Of that, well, it's worse\nthan that in some ways because the crucifixion exemplifies the worst possible death. But that isn't the only\nelement of the struggle because mythologically classically, after Christ's death, he herlads hell. And what that means, as far\nas I can tell psychologically, is that you're not only\nrequired, let's say, to take on the full\nexistential burden of life and to welcome it\nregardless of what it is, and to maintain your upward aim, despite all temptations to the contrary. But you also have to confront the root of malevolence itself. So it's not merely tragedy. And I think the malevolence\nis actually worse. And the reason I think that is because I know the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder, and most people who encounter, let's say, a challenge that's so brutal\nthat it fragments them, it isn't mere suffering\nthat does that to people. It's an encounter with\nmalevolence that does that to people, their own sometimes, often by the way, soldier\nwill go out into a battlefield and find out that there's a part of him that really enjoys the mayhem and that conceptualization\ndoesn't fit in well with everything he thinks\nhe knows about himself and humanity. And after that contact with\nthat dark part of himself, he never recovers. That happens to people. And it happens to people who encounter bad actors in the world too. If you're a naive person and the right narcissistic\npsychopath comes your way, you are in like mortal\ntrouble because you might die. But that's not where the trouble ends. - If there's a young man\nin their twenties listening to this, how do they escape the pull of Dostoevsky's \"Notes From Underground\"? With the eyes open to the world, how do they select the adventure? - So there's other characterizations of the divine, say, in\nthe Old Testament story. So one pattern of characterization that I think is really\nrelevant to that question is the conception of God as\ncalling and conscience. Okay, so what does it mean? It's a description of the manner in which your\ndestiny announces itself to you. And I'm using that terminology and it's distinguishable\nsay from Nietzsche's notion that you create your own values. It's like, part of the way you\ncan tell that that's wrong is that you can't voluntarily gerrymander your own interests, right? Like you find some things interesting and that seems natural and autonomous and other things you\ndon't find interesting and you can't really force yourself to be interested in them. Now, so what is the domain of interest that makes itself manifest to you? Well, it's like an autonomous spirit. It's like certain things\nin your field of perception are illuminated to you think,\noh, that's interesting, that's compelling, that's gripping. Rudolf Otto, who studied the phenomenology of religious experience\ndescribed that as numinous, the thing grips you 'cause\nyou're compelled by it. And maybe it's also\nsomewhat anxiety provoking. It's the same reaction that like a cat has to a dog when when the\ncat's hair stands on end. That's an awe response. And so there's gonna be things in your phenomenological\nfield that pull you forward, compel you, that's like the voice of\npositive emotion and enthusiasm. Things draw you into the world. Might be love, might\nbe aesthetic interest. It might be friendship,\nit might be social status, it might be duty and industriousness. Like there's various domains\nof interest that shine for people, that's sort\nof on the positive side. God is calling, right? That would be akin to the\nspirit of adventure for Abraham. But there's also, God is conscience. And this is a useful thing to know too. Certain things bother you. They take root within you and they turn your thoughts\ntowards certain issues. Like there are things you're interested in that you've pursued your whole life. There are things I'm\ninterested in that I felt as a moral compulsion. And so you could think, and\nI think the way you can think about it technically is that\nsomething pulls you forward so that you move ahead and you develop and then another voice. This is a voice of negative emotion, says, while you're moving forward, stay on this narrow pathway, right? And it'll mark deviations and\nit marks deviations with shame and guilt and anxiety, regret. And that actually has\na voice, don't do that. Well, why not? Well, you're wandering off\nthe straight narrow path. So the divine marks the\npathway forward and reveals it, but then puts up the\nconstraints of conscience. And the divine in the Old\nTestament is portrayed not least as the dynamic\nbetween calling and conscience. - What do you do with\nthe negative emotions? You didn't mention envy. There's some really dark ones that can really pull you\ninto some bad places. Envy, fear. - Yeah, envy's a really bad one. Pride and envy are among the worst. Those are the sins of Cain, by the way, in the story of Cain and Abel 'cause Cain fails because his\nsacrifices are insufficient. He doesn't offer his best,\nand so he's rejected. And that makes him bitter and unhappy. And he goes to complain to God. And God says to him two things. He said, God tells him if your sacrifices were\nappropriate, you'd be accepted. It's a brutal thing,\nit's a brutal rejoinder. And he also says, you can't blame your\nmisery on your failure. You could learn from your failure. When you failed, you invited\nin the spirit of envy and resentment and you\nallowed it to possess you. And that's why you're miserable. And so Cain is embittered by that response and that's when he kills Abel. And so you might say, well, how do you fortify yourself against\nthat pathway of resentment? And part of classic religious practice is aimed to do that precisely. What's the antithesis of envy? Gratitude. That's something you can practice, right? And I mean literally practice. - I think envy is one\nof the biggest enemies for a young person. Because basically you're\nstarting from nowhere. Life is hard, you've achieved nothing. And you're striving and you're\nfailing constantly because. - And you see other people whom you think aren't\nhaving the same problem. - Yeah, and they succeed. And they could be your neighbor,\nthey could be succeeding by a little bit or somebody on the internet succeeding by a lot. And I think that that can\nreally pull a person down. That kind of envy can\nreally destroy a person. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Well, the gratitude element\nwould be something like, well, yeah, you don't know anything\nand you're at the bottom, but you're not 80. You know, one of the best predictors of wealth in the United States is age. So then you might say,\nwell, who's got it better? The old rich guy or the young poor guy. And I would say most old\nrich guys would trade their wealth for youth. So it's not exactly clear\nat all at any stage, who's got the upper hand,\nwho's got the advantage? And you know, you could say, well, I've got all these\nburdens in front of me because I'm young and oh my God. Or you could say, every dragon has its treasure and that's actually a\npattern of perception. You know, I'm not saying that people don't have their challenges. They certainly do, but\ndiscriminating between a challenge and an opportunity is\nvery, very difficult. And learning to see a\nchallenge as an opportunity, that's the beginning of wisdom. - It's interesting, I\ndon't know how it works. Maybe you can elucidate, but when you have envy towards somebody, if you just celebrate them. So gratitude, but actually,\nas opposed to sort of ignoring and being grateful for\nthe things you have, like literally celebrate that person. It transforms it, like it lights the way. I don't know why that is exactly. - The only reason you're envious is because you see someone who\nhas something that you want. Okay, let's think about it. Well, first of all, the\nfact that they have it means that in principle, you could\nget it, at least someone has. So that's a pretty good deal. And then you might say, well,\nthe fact that I'm envious of that person means that\nI actually want something. And then you might think,\nwell, what am I envious of? I'm envious of their\nattractiveness to women. It's like, okay, well now you\nknow something about yourself. You know that one true motivation that's making itself manifest\nto you is that you wish that you would be the sort of person who was attractive to women. Now, of course, that's an extremely common\nlonging among men, period. But particularly among young men. It's like, well, what makes you so sure you couldn't have that? Well, how about, here's an answer. You don't have enough faith in yourself, and maybe you don't have enough faith in, well, I would say the divine. You don't believe that\nthe world is characterized by enough potentiality, so that even miserable you\nhas a crack at the brass ring. And like, I talked about this\nactually practically in one of my previous books, 'cause\nI wrote a chapter called compare yourself to who you are and not to someone else\nat the present time. Well, why? Well, your best benchmark\nfor tomorrow is you today. And you might not be able to have what someone else has on the particular axis\nyou're comparing yourself with them on. But you could make an\nincremental improvement over your current state, regardless of the direction\nthat you're aiming. And it is the case, and this is a law. The return on incremental\nimprovement is exponential or geometric and not linear. So even if you start, this is why the hero is\nalways born in a lowly place. Mythologically, right? Christ who redeems the\nworld is born in a manger with the animals to\npoverty stricken parents in the middle of a God-forsaken desert in a nondescript time and place, isolated. Well, why? Well, because everyone young struggles with their insufficiency. But that doesn't mean that great things can't\nmake themselves manifest. And part of the insistence\nin the biblical text, for example, is that it's incumbent on you to have the courage to\nhave faith in yourself and in the spirit of reality,\nthe essence of reality, regardless of how you\nconstrue the evidence at hand. Right, look at me, I'm so\nuseless, I don't know anything. I don't have anything, it's hopeless. I don't have it within me. The world couldn't offer\nme that possibility. Well, what the hell do\nyou know about that? This is what Job figures out in the midst of his suffering in the Book of Job 'cause Job is tortured terribly by God, who makes a bet with Satan\nhimself to bring him down. And Job's decision in the face\nof his intense suffering is, I'm not going to lose faith\nin my essential goodness. And I'm not going to lose\nfaith in the essential goodness of being itself, regardless of how terrible\nthe face it's showing to me at the moment happens to be. And I think, okay, what\ndo you make of that claim? Well, let's look at it practically. You're being tortured by\nthe arbitrariness of life. That's horrible, now you\nlose faith in yourself and you become cynical about being, so are you infinitely worse off instantly? And then you might say, well, yeah, but it's really asking a lot of people that they maintain faith even, well, even in their darkest hours. It's like, yeah, that might be asking\neverything from people. But then you also might ask, this is a very strange question, is it, if you were brought\ninto being by something that was essentially\ngood, wouldn't that thing that brought you into being demand that you make the best\nin yourself manifest? And wouldn't it be precisely\nwhen you most need that, that it would be that\nyou'd be desperate enough to risk what it would\ntake to let it emerge? - So you kind of make it seem\nthat reason could be the thing that takes you out of a place of darkness. Sort of finding that\ncalling through reason. I think it's also possible\nwhen reason fails you to just take the leap,\nnavigate not by reason, but by finding the thing that scares you. The risk, to take the risk, take the leap, and then figure it out\nwhile you're in the air. - Yeah, well, I think that's always part of a heroic adventure, you know, is that ability to cut the Gordian Knot. But you could also ask from\nan engineering perspective, okay, what are the axioms that make a decision like that possible? And the answer would be\nsomething like, I'm going to make the presumption\nthat if I move forward in good faith, whatever happens\nto me will be the best thing that could possibly happen,\nno matter what it is. And I think that's actually how you make an alliance with truth. And I also think that\ntruth is an adventure. And the way you make an alliance\nwith truth is by assuming that whatever happens to you,\nif you are living in truth, is the best thing that could happen. Even if you can't see\nthat at any given moment 'cause otherwise you'd say that truth would be just\nthe handmaiden of advantage. Well, I'm gonna say something\ntruthful and I pay a price. Well, that means I shouldn't have said it. Well, that possibly, but that's not the only\npossible standard of evaluation. Because what you're doing is you're making the outcome your deity, right. Well, I just reverse that and say, no, no, truth is the deity, the outcome is variable. But that doesn't eradicate\nthe initial axiom. Where's the constant,\nright, what's the constant? - It may be when you said Abraham was being fed by naked ladies. - That's an interpolation, obviously, but. Wouldn't have been out\nof keeping for the times. - But it does make me think\nsort of in stark contrast to Nietzsche own life that perhaps getting laid early on in life is a useful starter. Step one, get laid and\nthen go for adventure. There's some basic\nsatiation of basic desires. - I think it's perfectly reasonable to bring the sexual element in because it's a powerful motivating force and it has to be integrated. I don't think it's adventure,\nit's romantic adventure. - Right, right, but the\nlack of basic interaction, sexual interaction, I\nfeel like is the engine that drives towards that\ncynicism of the incel. In Dostoevsky, \"Notes From Underground.\" - Oh, it is but there's very\nlittle doubt about that. We know perfectly well anthropologically that the most unstable social\nsituation you can generate is young men with no access to women. That's not good, and they'll do anything, anything to reverse that situation. So that's very dangerous. But then I would also say\nthere's every suggestion that the pathway of adventure\nitself is the best pathway to romantic attractiveness. And we know this in some\nways, in a very blunt manner. The Google boys, the\nengineers who are too, what would you say, naively\noriented towards empirical truth to know when they're being\npolitically incorrect. They wrote a great book called\n\"A Billion Wicked Thoughts,\" which I really like,\nit's a very good book. And it's engineers as psychologists. And so they'll say all\nsorts of things that no one with any sense would ever\nsay that happened to be true. And they studied the pattern\nof pornographic fantasy, and women like pornographic\nstories, not images. So women's use of pornography is literary. Who are the main protagonists in female pornographic fantasy? Pirates, werewolves, vampires, surgeons. Billionaires, Tony Stark. And so the basic pornographic narrative is beauty and the beast,\nthose five categories, terrible aggressive male tamable\nby the right relationship, hot erotic attraction. And so I would say to the young men who, and I have many times to the young men who are locked in isolation, it's, first of all, join the bloody club because the default value of a 15-year-old male on\nthe mating market is zero. And there's reason for that, you know? And zero is a bit of an\nexaggeration, but not much. And the reason for that is,\nwell, what the hell do you know? Like, you're not good for anything. You have potential and maybe plenty, and hopefully that'll be made manifest, but you shouldn't be all upset because you're the same loser as everyone else your age has always been since the beginning of time. But then you might ask, well,\nwhat should I do about it? And the answer is, get yourself together. You know, stand up straight\nwith your shoulders back, take on some adventure, find your calling, abide by your conscience,\nput yourself together and you'll become attractive. And we know this is, look,\nwe know this is true. The correlation between\nmale sexual opportunity and relative masculine\nstatus is about 0.6. That's higher than the correlation between intelligence and\nacademic achievement. I don't think that there's\na larger correlation between two independent phenomena in the entire social science\nand health literature than the correlation between\nrelative male social status and reproductive success. It's by far the most\nfundamental determinant. - But what's the cause and effect there? - It's a loop, men are motivated\nto attain social status because it confers upon\nthem reproductive success. And that's not only\ncognitively, but biologically. I'll give you an example of this. There's a documentary I\nwatch from time to time, which I think is the most brilliant\ndocumentary I've ever seen. It's called \"Crumb,\" and it's the story of this underground cartoonist, Robert Crumb, who was in high\nschool, was in the category of males for whom a date\nwas not only not likely, but unimaginable. So he was at the bottom\nof the bottom rung. And almost all the reactions\nhe got from females wasn't just, no, it was like,\nare you out of your mind? Like with that contempt, right? And then he became successful. And so the documentary\nis super interesting because it tracks the utter pathology of his sexual fantasies because\nhe was bitter and resentful. And like, if you wanna\nunderstand the psychology of serial sexual killers and the like, and you watch Crumb, you'll\nknow, find out a lot more about that than anybody with any\nsense would want to know. But then he makes this\ntransition, and partly 'cause he does take the\nheroic adventure path. And he actually has a family and children. And he's actually a pretty\nfunctional person as opposed to his brothers, one of\nwhom commits suicide. And one of whom is literally\na repeat sexual offender. It's a brutal documentary. But what he did in his adolescence after being rejected was he\nfound what he was interested in. He was a very good artist, he\nwas very interested in music, and he started to pursue\nthose sort of single-mindedly. And he became successful. And as soon as he became successful and the documentary\ntracks this beautifully, he's immediately attractive to women. And then you might ask too,\neven if you're cynical, it's like, well, why do I have to perform for women? And the answer to that is something like, why the hell should they have anything to do with you, if you're useless? They're gonna have infants. They don't need another one, right? Partly the reason that\nwomen are hypergamous, they want males who are of\nhigher status than they are, is because they're trying to redress the reproductive burden. And it's substantial. I mean, the female of\nany species is the sex that devotes more to the\nreproductive function. That's a more fundamental definition than chromosomal differentiation. And that's taken to its\nultimate extreme with humans. And so of course, women are\ngonna want someone around that's useful because the\ncost of sex for them is an 18-year-old period of\ndependency with an infant. So I think the adventure comes first. - Heroic adventure comes first. - Well, it's complex\nbecause the other problem, let's say with the Crumb boys, is that their mother was\nextremely pathological and they didn't get a lot of genuine feminine\nnurturance and affection. - Oh, of course, but the family and society are not going\nto help you most of the time with the heroic adventure, right? They're going to be a\nbarrier versus a catalyst. - Well, in good families, they're both, because they put up\nconstraints on your behavior. But they, like, I've interviewed a lot of successful people about\ntheir calling, let's say 'cause I do that with\nall my podcast guests. How did the path that you took to success make itself manifest? And it's very, the pattern's very typical. Almost all the people that I've interviewed had\na mother and a father. Now, it's not invariant, but I'd say it's there in 99% of the time. It's really high, and both of the parents, or at least one of them, but often both were very encouraging of the person's interests\nand pathway to development. - That's fascinating. I've heard you analyze it that way before. And I had a reaction to that idea 'cause you focused on the\npositive of the parents. I feel like it was the, maybe I see biographies differently, but it feels like the struggle within the family was the\ncatalyst for greatness in a lot of biographies. Maybe I'm misinterpreting it. - No, no, I don't think you, I think that that's a reflection, maybe, correct me if I'm wrong. I think that's a\nreflection of that dynamic between positive and negative emotion. Like my son, for example,\nwho's doing just fine, he's firing on all cylinders\nas far as I'm concerned. He has a nice family, he\ngets along with his wife. He's a really good musician. He's got a company he's running well, he's a delight to be around. He was a relatively disagreeable infant. He was tough-minded. And so he didn't take no for an answer. And so there was some tussle\nin regulating his behavior. He spent a lot of time when he was two, sitting on the steps trying\nto get his act together. And so that was the constraint but that wasn't something that was, it's an opposition to him in a way because it was in opposition\nto the immediate manifestation of his hedonistic desires. But it was also an impetus\nto further development. The rule for me when he\nwas on the stairs was, as soon as you're willing to\nbe a civilized human being, you can get off the stairs. And you might think, well, that's nothing but arbitrary, super ego,\npatriarchal oppressive constraint. Or you could say, well, no, what I'm actually doing is facilitating his cortical maturation. Because when a child misbehaves, it's usually because\nthey're under the domination of some primordial emotional\nor motivational impulse. They're angry, they're overenthusiastic, they're upset, they're selfish. Like it's narrow\nself-centeredness expressed in a immature manner. - But see, okay, tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like the engine of greatness, at least on the male side of things, has often been trying to\nprove the father wrong or trying to gain the\nacceptance of the father. So that tension where the\nparent is not encouraging, like you mentioned, but\nis basically saying, no, you won't be able to do this. - Okay, so my observation\nas a psychologist has been that it's very, very difficult for someone to get their act together unless they have at least\none figure in their life that's encouraging and shows\nthem the pathway forward. So you can have a lot of\nadversity in your life, and if you have one person\naround who's a good model and you're neurologically intact, you can latch onto that model. Now, you can also find\nthat model in books. And people do that sometimes. Like I've interviewed people who had pretty fragmented\nchildhoods who turned to books and found the pattern\nthat guided them in like, let's say the adventures\nof the heroes of the past. Because that's a good\nway of thinking about it. And I read a book called\n\"Angela's Ashes\" that was written by an Irish author, Frank McCourt, fantastic book, beautiful book. And his father was an alcoholic\nof gargantuan proportions. He just, an Irish drinker\nwho drank every cent that came into the family and many of whose\nchildren died in poverty. And what Frank did is a\ntestament to the human spirit, is he sort of divided his father conceptually into two elements. There was sober morning\nfather who was encouraging and with whom he had a relationship. And then there was drunk and useless later afternoon\nand evening father. And he rejected the negative and he amplified his\nrelationship with the positive. Now, like he had other\nthings going for him, but he, you know, he did a very\ngood job of discriminating. And I mean, partly the\nquestion that you're raising is to what degree is it useful to\nhave a beneficial adversary? Yeah, and I mean, struggle-free\nprogress is not possible. And I think there are\nsituations under which where, you know, you might be\nmotivated to prove someone in your immediate circle wrong, but then that also implies\nthat at some level, for some reason you actually\ncare about their judgment. You know, you just didn't\nwrite them off completely. - Well, I mean, that's why\nI say there's an archetype of a young man trying to gain the approval of his father. And I think that repeats itself in a bunch of biographies that I've read. I don't know, there must\nhave been an engine somewhere that they found of\napproval, of encouragement, maybe in books, maybe in the mother or maybe the role of\nthe parents has flipped. - Well, my father was\nhard to please, very. - Did you ever succeed? - Yes, but it wasn't easy ever. - When was the moment when you succeeded? - Late, pretty late, like 40, maybe later. - Was it gradual or a definitive moment\nwhen a shift happened? - My father was always willing to approve of the things I did that were good. Although he was not effusive by any stretch of the imagination. And the standards were very high. Now, I was probably\nfortunate for me, you know, and it does bear on the\nquestion you're asking. It's like if you want someone\nto motivate you optimally, God, it's complicated because there has to be a temperamental dance\nbetween the two people. Like what you really want is for someone to apply the highest\npossible standards to you that you're capable of reaching. Right, and that's a vicious dance because you have to have a relationship with your child to do that properly. You know, 'cause if you\nwanna be optimally motivating as a father, you keep\nyour children on the edge. It's like you might not\nreward something in your child that you would think would\nbe good in someone else because you think they could do better. And so my father was\npretty clear about the idea that he always expected me to do better. And was that troublesome? It was like, I felt often when I was young that there was no pleasing him. But I also knew that that wasn't, I knew that that wasn't right. See, I actually knew that wasn't right because I could remember, especially I think when I was very young, that I did things that\nhe was pleased about. I knew that was possible. So it wasn't unpredictable and arbitrary. It was just difficult. - It sounds like he's hit\na pretty good optimal, but it's for each individual\nhuman that optimal differs. - Well, that's why you have to have a relationship with your children. You have to know them and\nwell with yourself too, and with your wife, you can't hit that optimal, that optimal is probably love. That's because love isn't just acceptance. Love is acceptance and encouragement. And it's not just that either,\nit's also no, don't do that. That's beneath you,\nyou're capable of more. And how harsh should that be? It's like, that's a really hard question. You know, like if you really love someone, you're not gonna put up\nwith their stupidity. Don't do that, you know,\none of the rules I had with my little kids was don't do anything that makes you look like\nan idiot in public, why? Because I don't want you\ndisgracing yourself, why not? Because I like you, I think you're great and you're not gonna act\nlike a bloody fool in public so that people get the\nwrong idea about you, no. - What about inside a relationship? How a successful relationship is? How much challenge, how much peace? Is a successful relationship, one that is easy, one that is challenging? - I would say to some degree that depends on your temperament. My wife is quite a provocative person, and there are times when\nI suppose do I wish that, there are times when I casually wish that she was easier to get along with. But as soon as I think about\nit, I don't think that. Because I've always liked her. We were friends ever\nsince we were little kids. And she plays rough and I\nlike that as it turns out. Now that doesn't mean it isn't\na pain from time to time, but, you know, and that is gonna be a\ntemperamental issue to some degree and an issue of negotiation. Like she plays rough, but fair. And the fair part has been\nestablishing that's been part of our ongoing negotiation. - And part of it is in the play, you get to find out about yourself\nor what your temperament is because I don't think that\nthat's clear until it's tested. - Oh, definitely not, definitely not. You find out all sorts of things about yourself in a\nrelationship, that's for sure. Well, and partly the reason\nthat there is provocative, especially from women\nin relationship to men, is they want to test them out. It's like, can you hold your temper when someone's bothering you? Well, why would a woman wanna know that? Well, maybe she doesn't want\nyou to snap and hurt her kids. And so how's she gonna\nfind that out, ask you? Well, you're gonna say,\nwell, I'd never do that. It's like, never, eh, let's find out if it's never. So we don't know how\npeople test each other out in relationships, or why exactly. But it's intense and necessary. - What's your, and what's in general, should a man's relationship\nwith temper be? - You should have one and you\nshould be able to regulate it. Like that's part of that\nattractiveness of the monstrous that characterizes women's fantasies. Right, because, and Nietzsche\npointed this out too, to go back to Nietzsche, you know, one of Nietzsche's claims was that most of what passes for morality\nis nothing but cowardice. You know, I'd never cheat on my wife. It's like, is there anybody asking you to, that you actually find attractive? Or are there dozens of\npeople asking you to that you find attractive? It's like, well, I would never cheat. It's like, no, you just\ndon't have the opportunity. Now I'm not saying that\neveryone's in that position, you know, that they would cheat even if they had the opportunity,\nbecause that's not true. But, and it's the same with regards to, oh, I'm a peaceful man. It's like, no, you're not,\nyou're just a weak coward. You wouldn't dare to have a confrontation, physical or metaphysical, and you're passing it off as morality because you don't want to\ncome to terms with the fact of your own weakness and cowardice. And part of the, what I would say is twisted\npseudo Christian morality that Nietzsche was criticizing\nwas exactly of that sort. And it tied into resentment and envy. And he tied that in explicitly, said that failure in life\nmasked by the morality, that's nothing but weak cowardice turns to the resentment that undermines and destroys everything. And it does that purposefully. - Yeah, I think it was\ncriticizing if under the facade of niceness, there's\nan ocean of resentment. - Yeah, that's for sure, that's for sure. That's also the danger of being\ntoo forthcoming with people. See, this is another thing,\nlet's say about my wife who's not particularly agreeable. It's like she's not\nparticularly agreeable, but she's not resentful. And that's because she\ndoesn't give things away that she isn't willing to. And if you're agreeable and nice and you're conflict avoidant,\nyou'll push yourself too far to please the other person. And then that makes you\nbitter and resentful. So that's not helpful. - Do you think you'll be in trouble for saying this on a podcast later? - No, no, we know each other pretty well. And like I said, it's a\ntrait that I find admirable. It's provocative and challenging. - And it seems to work. - Well, we've been together 50 years, so. - Quick pause, bathroom break. If we can descend from\nthe realm of ideas down to history and reality. I would say the time between World War I and World War II was one of history's biggest testing of ideas and really the most\ndramatic kinds of ideas that helped us understand\nthe nature of good and evil. I just want to ask you sort of a question about good and evil. Churchill in many ways was not a good man. Stalin, as you've documented extensively, was a horrible man. But you can make the case\nthat both were necessary for stopping an even worse\nhuman being in Hitler. So to what degree do you need\nmonsters to fight monsters? Do you need bad men to be able to fight off greater evils? - It's everything in its proper\nplace is the answer to that. You know, we might think that our life would be\neasier without fear. Let's say, we might say that our life would be\neasier without anger or pain, but the truth of the matter is that those things are beneficial, even though they can\ncause great suffering, but they have to be in their proper place. And that capacity that could in one context be\na terrible force for evil can, in the proper context, be the\nmost potent force for good. A good man has to be formidable. And partly what that means,\nas far as I can tell, is that you have to be able to say no and no means, like I\nthought a lot about no, working as a clinician, because I did a lot of\nstrategic counseling with my clients in a lot of\nextremely difficult situations. And I learned to take apart what no meant. And also when dealing\nwith my own children, because I used no sparingly, because it's a powerful weapon,\nlet's say, but I meant it. And with my kids, what it meant was, if you continue that pattern of behavior, something you do not\nlike will happen to you with 100% certainty. And when that's the case and you're willing to\nimplement it, you don't have to do it very often. With regards to monstrosity, it's like weak men aren't\ngood, they're just weak. That's Nietzsche's observation. That's partly, again, why he was tempted to place\nthe will to power, let's say, and to deal with that\nnotion in a manner that, when it was tied with the revaluation of all values was counterproductive and counterproductive\nin the final analysis. It's not like there wasn't something to what he was driving at. You know, formidable men are admirable and you know, don't mess with them. Douglas Murray's a good example of that. He's, you know, he's a rather slight guy, but he's got a spine of steel and there's no more than a bit\nof what's monstrous in him. And Jocko Willink is like that, and Joe Rogan is like\nthat, and you're like that. - But there's a different level. I mean, if you look, to me, Churchill might represent the\nthing you're talking about, but World War II, Hitler would not be\nstopped without Stalin. - Well, I wonder, yes, yes. - And if I may insert into\nthis picture of complexity, Hitler would've not\nstopped until he enslaved and exterminated the entirety\nof the Slavic people, the Jewish people, the\nSlavic people, the gypsies, everybody who's not Aryan, but then Stalin in the\nmass rape of German women by the Red Army as they march\ntowards Berlin, is a kind of manifestation, the full\nmonstrosity that a person can be. - You can easily be in this situation. You can easily unfortunately\nfind yourself in a situation where all you have in front of you are a variety of bad options. You know, that's partly\nwhy, if you have any sense, you try to conduct yourself\nvery carefully in life because you don't want to be in a position where you've made so many mistakes that all the options\nleft to you are terrible. And so you said, well, was it\nnecessary to ally with Stalin? It's like, well, it's very difficult to second guess the trajectory of something as complex as World War II but we could say casually, at least as Westerners have in general, that that alliance was necessary. Now, I think the mistake that\nthe West made in the aftermath of World War II was in not\ndealing as forthrightly with the catastrophes of communism as an ideology as we did with fascism. And that's especially true of the intellectuals in the universities. I mean, it was very common\nwhen I was teaching, both at Harvard and at\nthe University of Toronto for the students in my personality class where we studied Solzhenitsyn, who's actually an existential\npsychologist in many ways, and a deep one, none of them knew anything about the Soviet atrocities. None of them knew anything\nabout what happened in Ukraine. And the death of 6\nmillion productive people. Had no idea that the communists\nkilled tens of millions of people in the aftermath\nof the Russian Revolution. - They know even less about\nMao and The Great Leap Forward. - Right, right. Which some estimates are\na hundred million people. Now, you know, when your\nerror bars are in the tens of millions, well, that's a\nreal indication of a cataclysm. And nobody knows how many people\ndied from direct oppression or indirect in the Soviet Union. 20 million, it seems like\na reasonable estimate. Solzhenitsyn's upper bound\nwas higher than that. - And how do you measure\nthe intellectual output that was suppressed and killed off, the number of intellectuals, artists and writers that\nwere put into the gulags? - The productive farmers for that matter, and anyone who was\nwilling to tell the truth. Right, absolutely, so, yeah, catastrophic. And so I think the West's failure wasn't so much allying with Stalin. I mean, it was Douglas MacArthur\nwho wanted to continue. He thought we should\njust take the Soviets out after the Second World War. And they removed them from\nany position of authority where such a thing might be made possible. And people were tired\nbut was MacArthur wrong? Well, he certainly wasn't\nwrong in his insistence that Stalin was as big a\nmonster as Hitler or bigger. So the valorization of\nthe leftist proclivity, the radical leftist proclivity\nis the sin of the West, I think more intensely\nthan allying with Stalin. - Tricky nuanced topic. But if we look at the modern day and the threat of communism\nMarxism in the United States, to me it's disrespectful to the atrocities of the 20th century to call somebody like\nKamala Harris a communist. But I see the sort of\nescalation of the extremeness of language being used\nwhen you call somebody like Donald Trump a fascist,\nthen it makes total sense to then use similar extreme terminology for somebody like Kamala Harris. But maybe I could ask your evaluation, if you look at the\npolitical landscape today, somebody like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. - Okay, well, the first thing\nI would say is that I think that viewing the political\nlandscape of today as a political landscape\nis actually wrong. I think it's not the\nright frame of reference, because what I see happening\nare a very small percentage of dark tetrad personality types. So Machiavellian,\nmanipulative, narcissistic, wanting undeserved attention, psychopathic that makes them predatory\nparasites and sadistic, because that goes along\nwith the other three. That's about in the serious manifestation, that's probably three\nto 5% of the population. And they're generally kept\nunder pretty decent control by civilized people and\nstable social interactions. I think that their\nmachinations are disinhibited by cost-free social media communication. So they gain disproportionate influence. Now, these people want\nundeserved recognition and social status and everything\nthat goes along with it, and they don't care how they get it 'cause when I say they want that, I mean that's all they want. - So in the realm of social\nmedia, you mentioned, yes, but are you also suggesting that they're overrepresented\nin the realm of politics, politicians and so on? - They're overrepresented in the realm of fractious political discourse because they can use ideas,\nfirst of all, they can use, let's say, the benevolent\nideas of the right and the benevolent ideas\nof the left, either one, and switch back and forth for\nthat matter as a camouflage for what they're actually up to. - So how do you, you've\ninterviewed a lot of people and you have a really powerful mind. You have a good read on people. So how do you know when you're sitting across from a psychopath? - I wouldn't say that I do know. In normal social circumstances,\nwe have evolved mechanisms to keep people like that under control. Let's say that you and I\nhave a series of interactions and you screw me over once. I'm not gonna forget that. Now, I might not write you\noff because of the one time, but if it happens three times, it's like we're not gonna\nplay together anymore. And in normal times, most of our social networks\nare connected and interacting. So like if you ripped me off three times and I noted that, I'm\ngonna tell everybody I know and they're gonna tell\neverybody they know, and soon everyone will know, and that's the end of your tricks. But that assumes that we know who you are and we're in continual communication. Well, all of that's gone online. So anonymity does that and\nso does the amplification of emotional intensity, by the social media platforms\nand their algorithms. I think what we're doing, this is happening on Twitter\ncontinually, is we're giving the 5% of psychopaths a\nradically disproportionate voice. And what they're doing is there's a bunch of them on the left, and they're all, we're so compassionate, and there's a bunch of them on the right, and at the moment they're\nall, we're so Christian and free speech oriented. It's like, no, you're not,\nyou're narcissistic psychopaths and that's your camouflage. And you hide behind your\nanonymity and you use fractious and divisive language to attract fools and to elevate your social\nstatus and your clout. And not only that, to\ngain, what would you say, satisfaction for your sadistic impulses. - See, the problem is, it's hard to tell who is the psychopath and who\nis a heterodox truth seeker. - Yeah, well, if you were charitable about Tucker Carlson's recent interview, you'd say that was exactly\nthe conundrum he faced. And it is hard, like I've\nthought about, for example, interviewing Andrew Tate, and\nI thought, I don't think so. And then I thought, why? I figured it's not obvious to me at all that he wouldn't charm me. So I knew this guy, Robert Hare. Robert Hare was the\nworld's foremost authority on psychopathy. He established the field\nof clinical analysis of psychopathic behavior. And Hare was a pretty agreeable guy. So, you know, he would give\npeople the benefit of the doubt. And he interviewed hundreds\nof serious psychopaths, like imprisoned violent offenders. And he told me in one of our conversations that every time he sat down with a violent offender psychopath, and he had a measure for psychopathy that was a clinical checklist, so he could identify the psychopaths from just the say run\nof the mill criminals. Every time he sat down with them, they pulled the wool over his eyes. And it wasn't in, he\nvideotaped the interviews. And it wasn't until later when\nhe was reviewing the videos that he could see what they were doing, but in person, their tricks\nwere more sophisticated than his detection ability. - Well, okay, this is fascinating because again, you're a great interviewer. I would love it if you\ninterviewed somebody like Putin. So this idea that you\nare a fool in the face of psychopathy just doesn't jive with me. - I'm an agreeable guy,\nthat's the problem, man. I'll give people the benefit\nof the doubt right away. - But that's good because the\nway you reveal psychopathy is by being agreeable, not weak, but seeking with empathy to\nunderstand the other person and in the details, in\nthe little nuanced ways that they struggle with questions, the psychopathy is revealed. So from a, we're kind of just\nto separate the two things. So one overrepresentation\nof psychopathy online with anonymity, that's a\nserious fascinating problem. But in the interview one-on-one. I don't know if the job of a human being in conversation is to\nnot talk to psychopaths, but to talk, I mean, like how\nwould you interview Hitler? - Well, you know, I've had very difficult\nclinical interviews with people in my clinical practice. - So how do you approach that? - Well, I really probably approach that the way I approach\nmost conversations. And it's something like,\nI'm going to assume that you're playing a straight\ngame, but I'm gonna watch, and if you throw the\nodd crooked maneuver in, then I'll note it. And after you do it three\ntimes, I'll think, okay, I see. I thought we were playing one game, but we're actually playing another one. And if I'm smart enough to pick that up, that usually works out\nquite successfully for me. But I'm not always smart\nenough to pick that up. - But see, here's the nice thing. There's the one-on-one conversation that's not recorded is\ndifferent than the one that's listened by a lot of people. Because I would venture to, I trust the intelligence of\nthe viewer and the listener. - Right, yeah, yeah. - To detect even better than you. - Yes, and I think\nthat's true, by the way. - To detect the psychopathy. - Yeah, I've had the odd\ninterview with people that I wasn't happy with having organized, because I felt that I\nhad brought their ideas to a wider audience than\nmight've been appropriate. But my conclusion and the\nconclusion of my producers and the people I talked to was that we could run the\ninterview, the discussion and let the audience sort it out. And I would say they do. So I think as a general\nrule of thumb, that's true. And I also think that the long form interviews\nare particularly good at that because it's not that easy to maintain a manipulative stance,\nespecially if you're empty for like two and a half hours. So you get tired, you get irritable, you show that you lose the track. You're gonna start leaking\nout your mistakes, and so. - And that actually is the\ncase for all the world leaders. I would say one hour is too short and something happens at\nlike two hour plus mark where you start to leak. And I trust in the\nintelligence of the listener to sort, to detect that. - Yeah, and it might be the intelligence of the distributed crowd. And I mean, that is what I've seen with the YouTube interviews is\nthat it's hard to fool people as such over a protracted period of time. And I guess it's partly because everybody brings a\ndifferent, slightly different set of falsehood detectors to the table. And if you aggregate that,\nit's pretty damn accurate. - But of course, you\nknow, it's complicated because ideas of Nazi ideology\nspread in the twenties. There was a real battle\nbetween Marxism and Nazis. - Oh, yeah.\n- And I believe there's some attempts at\ncensorship of Nazi ideology. Censorship very often does the opposite. It gives the fringe ideologies power if they're being censored. Because that's an indication that the man in power doesn't\nwant the truth to be heard. This kind of idea. And that just puts fuel to the fire. - It also motivates the paranoid types because one of the reasons that paranoia spirals out of control is because paranoid people almost inevitably end up being persecuted\nbecause they're so touchy and so suspicious that people\nstart to walk on eggshells around them as if there are things going on behind the scenes. And so then they get more\ndistrustful and more paranoid, and eventually they start\nmisbehaving so badly that they are actually persecuted often by legal authorities. And you know, it's down\nthe rabbit hole they go. And so, you know, Musk is\nbetting on that to some degree. Right, he believes that free expression on Twitter, X will sort itself\nout and be of net benefit. And I follow a lot of\nreally bad accounts on X 'cause I like to keep an eye\non the pathology of the left, let's say, and the pathology of the right, thinking, at least in my clinical way that I'm watching the\npsychopaths dance around and try to do with their subversion. And it's an ugly place to\ninhabit, that's for sure. But it's also the case\nthat a very tiny minority of seriously bad actors can have a disproportionate influence. And one of the things\nI've always hoped for, for social media channels is that they separate the anonymous accounts from the verified accounts. They should just be in\ndifferent categories. People who will say what they think and take the hits to their\nreputation, anonymous types. If you want to see what the anonymous types\nsay, you can see it. But don't be confusing\nthem with actual people 'cause they're not the same. We know that people are,\nwe know that people behave more badly when they're anonymous. That's a very well established\npsychological finding. Well, and I think the danger\nto our culture is substantive. I think the reason that\neverything, perhaps the reason that everything started\nto go sideways pretty seriously around 2015 is because we invented these\nnew modes of communication. We have no idea how to police them. And so the psychopathic\nmanipulators, they have free reign. About 30% of the internet is pornography. A huge amount of internet\ntraffic is outright criminal. And there's a penumbra around that. That's, you know, psychopathic, narcissistic troublemaking trolls. And that might constitute the bulk of the interactions online. And it's partly because people\ncan't be held responsible. So the free riders have free reign. - It's a fascinating technical challenge of how to make our society resilient to the psychopaths on\nthe left and the right. - Yeah, it might be the\nfundamental problem of the age, given the amplification of communication by our social networks. - And so to generalize across psychopaths. You could also think about bots which behave similar to\npsychopaths in their certainty and not caring, they're\nmaximizing some function. They're not caring about\nanything else, attention, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, short-term\nattention even worse. Because you might, you know,\nthat's another problem, if the algorithms are\nmaximizing for the grip of short-term attention, they're acting like immature\nagents of attention. Right, and so then imagine\nthe worst case scenario is negative emotion garners more attention and short-term gratification\ngarners more attention. So then you're maximizing for the grip of short-term attention\nby negative emotion. I mean, that's not gonna be a principle. We were talking earlier about,\nyou know, unsustainable, unifying axioms. That's definitely, that's\ndefinitely one of them. Maximize for the spread\nof negative attention, negative emotion that\ngarners short-term attention. Jesus, brutal. - I just, I tend to not think there's\nthat many psychopaths. So maybe to push back a little bit, it feels like there's a\nsmall number of psychopaths. - Three to 5% is the estimate worldwide. - In terms of humans? But in terms of the pattern\nof stuff we see online, my hope is that a lot of people on the extreme left and extreme right, or just the trolls in\ngeneral are just young people kind of going through the similar stuff that we've been talking\nabout, trying on the cynicism and the resentment, there's\na drug aspect to it. There's a pull to that, to talk shit about somebody,\nto take somebody down. I mean, there is some pleasure in that. There's a dark pull\ntowards that, and I think. - That's the sadistic pull. - And I think a lot of people, I mean, you see, when you say sadistic, it makes it sound like some\nkind of, it's a pathology. - It's pleasure in the\nsuffering of others. - Right, but I just think that all of us have the capacity for that. All humans have the capacity for that. - Yeah, some more than others,\nbut everyone to some degree. - And when you're young, you don't understand the full implications of that on your own self. So if you participate in\ntaking other people down, that's gonna have a cost\non your own development as a human being, like it's gonna take you towards a Dostoevsky\n\"Notes From Underground\" in the basement, cynical,\nall that kind of stuff. - Yeah, alone. - Which is why a lot of\nyoung people try it out. You know, the reason is\nyou get older and older, you realize that there's\na huge cost to that, so you don't do it. But there's young people that, so like I would like to sort of believe and hope that a large number of people who are trolls are just\ntrying out the derision. - No doubt. - And then so they can be saved. They could be helped. They could be shown that\nthere's more growth, there's more flourishing to\ncelebrating other people. And it actually, and criticizing ideas, but not in the way of derision LOL, but by formulating your\nown self in the world, by formulating your ideas\nin a strong, powerful way, and also removing the cloak of anonymity and just standing behind your ideas. And carrying the responsibility\nof those ideas, yeah. - I think all of that is right. I think the idea that\nthat's more likely to occur among young people, that's clear. People as they mature, get more\nagreeable and conscientious. So we actually know that what\nyou said is true technically. It's definitely the case that there's an innate\ntilt towards pleasure in that sort of behavior. And it is associated to some degree with dominance driving. And I do think it's true, as\nyou pointed out, that many of the people who are\ntoying with that pattern can be socialized out of it. In fact, maybe most people, even the repeat criminal types tend to desist in their late\ntwenties, so imagine that. So 1% of the criminals\ncommit 65% of the crimes. So imagine that that 1% are the people that you're really concerned with. They often have stable\npatterns of offending that emerged in very, very young, like even in infancy, and continued through adolescence and into adulthood. If you keep them in prison\nuntil they're in their, in the middle of their late\ntwenties, most of them stop. And that might be the\neasiest way to understand that might just be delayed maturation. So are most people salvageable? Yes, definitely. Is everyone salvageable? Well, at some point it becomes, first of all, they have\nto wanna be salvaged. That's a problem. But then it also becomes\nsomething like, well, how much resources are\nyou gonna devote to that? Like the farther down the\nrabbit hole you've gone, the more energy it takes to haul you up. So there comes a point\nwhere the probability that you'll be able to get\nenough resources devoted to you to rescue you from the pit of\nhell that you've dug is zero. And that's a very sad thing. And it's very hard to around someone who's in that situation, very, very hard. - And it seems that it's\nmore likely that the leaders of movements are going to be psychopaths, and the followers of movements are going to be the people that we're\nmentioning that are kind of lost themselves to the\nideology of the movement. - Well, we know that what you said is true even\nhistorically to a large degree, because Germany was\nsuccessfully de-nazified. And it's not like everybody who participated in every element of the Nazi movement\nwas brought to justice. Not in the least, the same\nthing happened in Japan. So to some degree, the same thing happened in South Africa. Right, and so, and it's\nthe case for example, also in the stories that we\nwere referring to earlier, the biblical stories, the\npatriarchs of the Bible, most of them are pretty bad people when they first start out. Like Jacob's a really good, Jacob is the one who becomes Israel. He's a major player in\nthe biblical narrative. And he's a pretty bad actor\nwhen he first starts out, he's a mama's boy, he's a liar. He steals from his own brother and in a major way he deceives his father. He's a coward, you know, and\nyet he turns his life around. - So be careful, the leaders\nyou idolize and worship, but then it's not always clear to know who is the good and who's\nthe evil, it's hard. You have been through some\ndark places in your mind, over your life. What have been some of your darker hours and how did you find the light? - Well, I would say I started\ncontending with the problem of evil, very young, 13 or 14. And that's been the main, that was my main motivation of study for 30 years, I guess something like that. At the end of that 30 years,\nit became more and more, I became more and more interested in fleshing out the alternative. Like once I became\nconvinced that evil existed, and that was very young, I always believed that if you could understand\nsomething well enough that you could formulate a solution to it. But it turns out that seeing evil and understanding that it\nexists is less complicated than a technical\ndescription of its opposite. Like, what is good? You can say, well, it's not that. For sure it's not Auschwitz,\nhow about we start there? It's as far from Auschwitz as you can get. It's as far from enjoying being an Auschwitz camp guard as you can get. Okay, well where are you when\nyou're as far away from that as you could possibly get? What does that mean? And it does have something to do with play as far as I'm concerned. Like, I think the antithesis\nof tyranny is play. So that took me a long time to\nfigure out that specifically, you know, and so that was very dark. Like I spent a lot of time studying the worst behaviors that I could discover abstractly in books, but also in my clinical practice and, and in my observations of people. And so that's rough. More recently, I was very ill and in a tremendous amount of pain, like that lasted pretty much without any break for three years. And what was particularly useful to me then was the strength\nof my relationships, my immediate relationships,\nmy friendships. Also the relationships that I\nhad established more broadly with people, you know. Because by the time I became ill, I was reasonably well known and people were very supportive\nwhen I was having trouble. And that was very helpful. But it's certainly the case that it was the connections I had,\nparticularly with my family, but also with my friends,\nthat were the saving grace. And that's something to\nknow, you know, I mean. It's necessary to bear the burdens of the world on your own\nshoulders, that's for sure. The burdens of your own existence and whatever other\nresponsibilities you can mount. But that by no means, means that you can or should do it alone. And so, you know, you might say, well, welcoming the adversity of life as a redemptive challenge is a task that's beyond the ability\nof the typical person or even maybe of anyone. But then when you think,\nwell, you're not alone, maybe you're not alone socially,\nyou're not alone familial, maybe you're not alone\nmetaphysically as well. You know, there's an insistence. And I think it's true. There's an insistence, for example, in the old and the New\nTestament alike, that the more darkness you're willing\nto voluntarily encounter, the more likely it is\nthat the spirit of Abraham and the patriarchs will walk with you. And I think that's right. Like I think it's sort of\ntechnically true in that the best parts of yourself\nmake themselves manifest. If you want to think about it that way, the best parts of yourself,\nwhatever that means, make themselves manifest, when you're contending actively and voluntarily with the\nmost difficult challenges, why wouldn't it be that way? And then you could think,\nwell, that's yourself. It's like, well, are the\nbest unrevealed parts of you yourself? Well, no, they're a kind\nof metaphysical reality. They're not yet manifest,\nthey only exist in potential. They transcend anything\nyou're currently capable of. But they have an existence,\nyou could call that yourself. But like it was Jung's contention, for example, with regards\nto such terminology that the reason we used the\nterm self instead of God is because when God was\ndispensed with, let's say, by the processes Nietzsche described, we just found the same thing deep within the instinctive realm. Let's say we found it at the bottom of the things instead of at the top. It's like, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter fundamentally, what matters is whether\nor not that's a reality. And I think it's the fundamental reality because I do think that the\ndeeper you delve into things, this is what happens to Moses when he encounters the burning bush. So Moses is just going about\nhis life, he's a shepherd. He's an adult, he has wives, he has children, he has responsibilities. He's left his home and\nhe's established himself. And so things are pretty good for Moses. And then he's out by\nMount Horeb in that story. But it's the central\nmountain of the world. It's the same mountain as Sinai, which is the place where\nheaven and earth touch. And he sees something that\ngrabs his attention, right? That's the burning bush, and\nbush is a tree, that's life. That's the tree of life. And the fact that it's on fire is that's life exaggerated 'cause everything that's alive is on fire. And so what calls to Moses is like the\nspirit of being itself. And it tracks him off the beaten track and he decides to go investigate. So Moses is everyone who goes off the beaten\ntrack to investigate. And so as he investigates, he delves more and more deeply until\nhe starts to understand that he's now walking on sacred ground. So he takes off his shoes, and that's a symbolic reference\nof identity transformation. He's no longer walking the same path. He no longer has the same\nidentity, he's in a state of flux. And that's when what\nhappens is that he continues to interact with this calling. And Moses asks what it\nis that's being revealed. And God says, I'm the\nspirit of being itself. That's basically the\nanswer, I am what I am. It's a more complex utterance than that. I am what I will be, I\nam what was becoming. It's all of that, at the same\ntime, it's the spirit of being that's speaking to him, the\nspirit of being and becoming. And it tells Moses that he now, because he's delved so deeply\ninto something so compelling, his identity has transformed. And he's become the leader\nwho can speak truth to power. And so he allies himself\nwith his brother Aaron, who's the political arm,\nand who can communicate. And he goes back to Egypt\nto confront the tyrant. And that's an indication of that idea that if you wrestle with life properly, that the spirit of being\nand becoming walks with you. And it's like, how can that not be true? 'Cause the contrary would be that there would be no\ngrowth in challenge. Well, that's, you have to be infinitely\nnihilistic to believe that. - It's obvious, but it's also just fascinating\nthat hardship is the thing that ends up being the\ncatalyst for delving deeply. - It's hardship voluntarily undertaken. Well, and it's crucially true. Look, if you bring someone into therapy, let's say, they're afraid of elevators and you trick them into getting near an elevator, you'll make them worse. But if you negotiate with them so that they voluntarily\nmove towards the elevator on their own recognizance,\nthey'll overcome their fear and they become generally braver. But it has to be voluntary. - See, I gotta push back and explore with you the\nquestion of voluntarily. Let's look at Nietzsche. He suffered through several health issues throughout his life,\nmigraines, eyesight issues, digestive problems, depression\nwith suicidal thoughts. And yet he is one of the greatest minds in\nthe history of humanity. So were these problems that\nhe was suffering arguably involuntarily a feature or a bug? - That's a good question,\nthe same thing happens in the story of Job 'cause Job is a good man,\nGod himself admits it. And the Satan comes along and says to God, I see you're pretty proud of your man there, Job. God says, yeah, he's doing pretty well. And Satan says, I think it's just because things are easy for 'em. Let me have a crack at\nhim and see what happens. And God says, yeah, I think\nyou're wrong, do your worst. Right, and that's how people\nfeel when those slings and arrows come at them. Let's say like Nietzsche,\nwell, Job's response to that. Now the story is set up so that what befalls Job is actually\nquite arbitrary, right? These catastrophes that you're describing, the volunteerism in Job is his refusal to despair even in the\nface of that adversity. And that seems like\nsomething like an expression of voluntary free will. He refuses to lose faith. And the way the story ends is that Job gets everything back and more. And, you know, so that's a\ndescent and ascent story. And a cynic might say, well, the ends don't justify the means. And I would say, fair enough. But that's a pretty shallow\ninterpretation of the story. What it indicates instead\nis that if you're fortunate, because let's not forget that, and you optimize your\nattitude even in the face of adversity, that there,\nit's not infrequently the case that your fortunes will reverse. You know, and I've found\nthat in many situations, the journalists whose\ngoal was most malicious in relationship to me,\nwho were most concerned with improving their\nown, what would you say? Fostering their own notoriety and gaining social status\nat my expense were the ones who did me the greatest favor. Those were the interviews that went viral. And so that's interesting, you know, because they were definitely the places where the most disaster was at hand. And I felt that in the aftermath,\nevery time that happened, my whole family was destabilized for like two months because things, it wasn't obvious at all which\nway the dice were gonna roll. - But you leaned into that. So in a sense that there's this kind of transformation from the involuntary to the voluntary basically\nsaying, bring it on. That act of bring it\non turns the hardship, involuntary hardship\ninto voluntary hardship. - Well, not necessarily, let's say, but you could say that's your best bet. Well, you know, I'm never going to say that you can transcend all catastrophe with the right attitude, because that's just too much to say. But I could say that in a dire situation, there's always an element of choice. And if you make the right choices, you improve the degree, you\nimprove your chances of success to the maximal possible degree. - It might be too much to say, but nevertheless this could be true. Viktor Frankl, Marcus Aurelius. - Well that's what the resurrection\nstory proclaims is that, you know, even under the darkest\nimaginable circumstances, the fundamental finale is\nthe victory of the good. And that seems to me to be true. - Do you have regrets when\nyou look back at your life? In the full analysis of it? - Well, as I said, I was very\nill for about three years and it was seriously brutal. Like every, this is no\nlie, every single minute of that three years was\nworse than any single time I'd ever experienced in\nmy entire life up to that. So that was rough. - Was the roughest the\nphysical or the psychological? - Pain.\n- Just literal pain. - Yeah, I was walking\nlike 10 to 12 miles a day, rain or shine, winter, didn't matter. Not good, and it was\nworse than that because as the day progressed,\nmy pain levels would fall until by 10, 11 at night\nwhen I was starting to get tired, I was approaching a, what would you say? I was approaching something\nlike an ordinary bad day. But as soon as I went to\nsleep, then the clock was reset and all the pain came back. And so it wasn't just that I was in pain, it was that sleep itself became an enemy. And that's really rough, man, because sleep is where you take refuge. You know, you're worn out, you're tired, and you go to sleep and you wake up and it's generally, it's\nsomething approximating a new day. This was like Sisyphus on steroids. And that was, it was very\ndifficult to maintain hope in that, because I would do what I could. Like, there were times when\nit took me like an hour and a half in the morning to stand up. And so I do all that and more or less put myself back into something remotely resembling human\nby the end of the day. And then I knew perfectly well\nexhausted if I fell asleep that I was gonna be right at the bottom of the bloody hill again. And so after a couple of years of that, it was definitely the\nfact that I had a family that carried me through that. - What did you learn about\nyourself, about yourself, and about the human mind from\nthat, from all of those days? - Well, I think I learned more gratitude for the people I had around me. And I learned how fortunate\nI was to have that and how crucial that was. My wife learned something similar. She was diagnosed with a form of cancer that as far as we know,\nkilled every single person who ever had it except\nher, it's quite rare. And her experience was that\nwhat really gave her hope and played at least a role in saving her, was the realization of the depth of love that her son in particular had for her. And that that says nothing\nabout her relationship with Mikhaila, with her daughter. It just so happened that it was\nthe revelation of that love, that it made Tammy understand\nthe value of her life in a way that she wouldn't have\nrealized of her own accord. We're very, very, there's no\ndifference between ourselves and the people that we love. And there might be no\ndifference between ourselves and everyone everywhere, but we can at least\nrealize that to begin with in the form of the people that we love. And I hope I'm better at that than I was. I think I'm better at it than I was. I'm a lot more grateful\nfor just ordinariness than I was because when I first recovered, I remember I was standing,\nfirst started to recover. I was standing in this pharmacy waiting for a prescription in a little town, and they weren't being\nparticularly efficient about it. And so I was in that standing in the aisle for like 20 minutes and I\nthought, I'm not on fire. I could just stand here for\nlike the rest of my life, just not being in pain and enjoying that. And, you know, that\nwould've been something that before that would've been, you know, I would've been impatient and raring to go 'cause I didn't have 20 minutes to stand in the middle of an aisle. And I thought, well, you know, if you're just standing there and you're not on fire,\nthings are a lot better than they might be. And I certainly, I know that, and I think I remember\nit almost all the time. - You gain a greater ability to appreciate the mundane moments of life. - Yeah, definitely. The miracle of the mundane, right? - Yeah. - I think Nietzsche had that\nbecause he was very ill. And so I suspect he had, you know, and he was\nregarded by the inhabitants of the village that he lived\nin near the end of his life as something approximating a saint. He apparently conducted\nhimself very admirably, despite all his suffering. - You know, but that\nstill, there's this tension as there is in much of Nietzsche's work between the miracle of the mundane, appreciating the miracle of the mundane versus fearing the\ntyranny of the mediocre. - It's more the mediocre and resentful. - Yes, but that's you giving\nhim a pass or seeing the good. - Well, fair enough, you know. - There's a kind of, I mean,\nthe tyranny of the mediocre, I always hated this idea that some people are better than others, and I understand it, but\nit's a dangerous idea. - This is why I like the\nstory of Cain and Abel, I would say, because Cain is mediocre, but that's because he\nrefuses to do his best. It's not something intrinsic to him. And I actually think that's\nthe right formulation because, you know, I had people in my\nclinical practice who were, they were lost in many dimensions from the perspective of comparison. One woman I remember in\nparticular, who, man, she had a lot to contend\nwith, she was not educated, she was not intelligent. She had a brutal family,\nlike terrible history of psychiatric hospitalization. And when I met her at a hospital, she was an outpatient\nfrom the psychiatric ward, and she had been in there with people that she thought were worse off than her. And they were, and that\nwas a long way down. That was like Dante's Inferno level down. It was a long-term,\npsychiatric inpatient ward. Some of the people had\nbeen there for 30 years. It made \"One Flew Over\nThe Cuckoo's Nest\" look like a romantic comedy. And she had come back to\nsee if she could take some of those people for a walk and was trying to find out how\nto get permission to do it. And so, you know, better\nthan other people. Some people are more intelligent, some people are more beautiful, some people are more athletic, maybe it's possible for everyone\nat all levels of attainment to strive towards the good. And maybe those talents that are given to people unfairly don't privilege them in relationship to their moral conduct. And I think that's true. Like there's no evidence, for example, that there's any correlation whatsoever between intelligence and morality. You're not better because you're smart. And what that also implies\nis if you're smart, you can be a lot better at being worse. - I think for myself, I'm just\nafraid of dismissing people because of my perception of them. - Yeah, well that's why we have that metaphysical presumption that everybody's made in\nthe image of God, right? Despite that immense\ndiversity of apparent ability. There's that underlying\nmetaphysical assumption that, yeah, we all vary in our perceived and actual utility in\nrelationship to any proximal goal, but all of that's\nindependent of the question of axiomatic worth. And that preposterous, as\nthat notion appears to be, it seems to me that\nsocieties that accept it as a fundamental axiomatic\npresumption are always the societies that you'd wanna\nlive in if you had a choice. And that to me is an existence proof for the utility of the presumption. And also, you know, if you treat people like that in your life,\nevery encounter you have, you make the assumption that, and it's an assumption of, what would you, it's radical equality of worth, despite individual variance in\nability, something like that. Man, your interactions go way better. I mean, everyone wants\nto be treated that way. Look, here's the developmental\nsequence for you. Naive and trusting, hurt and cynical. Okay, well, is hurt and cynical better than naive and trusting? It's like, yeah, probably. Is that where it ends? How about cynical and\ntrusting as step three, right? And then the trust becomes courage. It's like, yeah, I'll\nput my hand out for you, but it's not 'cause I'm a fool. And I think that's right because\nthat's the re-instantiation of that initial trust, right? That makes childhood magical and paradisal but it's the admixture\nof that with wisdom. It's like, yeah, you know, we could be, we could walk together\nuphill, but that doesn't mean, and I'll presume that that's your aim, but that doesn't mean that\nI'm not going to watch. - What's a better life, cynical and safe or hopeful and vulnerable to be hurt? - Oh you can't dispense\nwith vulnerable to be hurt. That's the other realization. It's like you're gonna stake\nyour life on something. You could stake your life on security, but it's not gonna help. You don't have that option. - So what do you do when you're betrayed ultimately by some people you come across? - Grieve and look elsewhere, do what you can to forgive and not least, so you\nlighten your own burden. Maybe do what you can to help\nthe person who betrayed you. And if that all proves impossible, then wash your hands of it and move on to the next adventure. - And do it again.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Boy, this life, something else. So we've been talking about\nsome heavy, difficult topics and you've talked about truth in your Nietzsche lectures and elsewhere. When you think, when you\nwrite, when you speak, how do you find what is true? You know, Hemingway said, all you have to do is write one true sentence. How do you do that? - Well, I would say first that\nyou practice that it's like that question is something, and Hemingway knew this\nat least to some degree, and he certainly wrote\nabout it, is that you have to orient your life upward\nas completely as you can. Because otherwise you can't distinguish between truth and falsehood. It has to be a practice. And for me, I started\nto become serious about that practice when I realized\nthat it was individual, it was the immorality of the\nindividual, the resentful, craven, deceitful immorality\nof the individual that led to the terrible atrocities\nthat humans engage in that make us doubt even our own worth. I became completely convinced of that, that the fundamental root cause of evil, let's say, wasn't\neconomic or sociological. That it was spiritual, just psychological. And that if that was the case, you had an existential\nresponsibility to aim upward and to tell the truth. And that everything depends on that. And I became convinced of that. And so then, look, you set your path with your orientation, that's how your perceptions work. As soon as you have a goal, a pathway opens up to\nyou and you can see it. And the world divides\nitself into obstacles and things that move you forward. And so the pathway that's in front of you depends on your aim. The things you perceive are\nconcretizations of your aim. If your aim is untrue,\nthen you won't be able to tell the difference\nbetween truth and falsehood. And you might say, well, how\ndo you know your aim is true? It's like, well, you\ncourse correct continually and you can aim towards the ultimate. Are you ever sure that your\naim is the right direction? You become increasingly\naccurate in your apprehension. - Is it like part of the\nprocess to cross the line, to go outside the Overton Window, to dip a toe outside the\nOverton Window for a bit? - Of course, that's what\nyou do in part in play. I was at the Comedy Mothership and every single comedian was\nlike completely reprehensible. All they were doing was saying\nthings that you can't say. Well, but it was in play. What I'm trying to do in my\nlectures is I'm on the edge. Like I have a question\nI'm trying to address and I'm trying to figure it out. I don't know where the\nconversation is going, truly. Like it's an exploration. And I think the reason that\nthe audiences respond is because they can feel\nthat it's a high wire act. You know, and I could fail and you know, my lectures\nhave degrees of success. Sometimes I get real fortunate and there's a perfect narrative arc. I have a question, I'm investigating it. It comes to a punchline\nconclusion just at the right time. And it's like the whole act is complete. And sometimes it's more fragmented, but I can tell when\nthe audience is engaged because everyone's silent, you know? Except maybe when they're laughing. - But there's a kind of\nsense that you're arguing with yourself and you're lecturing. It's beautiful, it's really\nbeautiful and powerful to watch. Like Nietzsche does the same. There's contradictions\nin what you're saying. There's a struggle in what you're saying. But I do think that when\nyou're doing the same on the internet, you get\npunished for the deviations, you get punished for the\nexploration, especially when that explores outside the Overton Window. - Look, if you're gonna\nplay hard in a conversation to explore, you're gonna say\nthings that are edgy, right? That are gonna cause trouble\nand that might be wrong. And that's another reason why free speech protection\nis so important. You actually have to protect the right, let's say in the optimal circumstance. You have to protect the right of well-meaning people to be wrong. Now you probably have to go beyond that to truly protect it, you have\nto even protect the right of people who aren't meaning\nwell to be wrong, you know? And we also need that because we're not always well-meaning, but I don't, you know, the alternative to that protection would be the insistence that people only say what\nwas 100% right all the time. - I'm also, I guess this is a call to our fellow humans\nnot to reduce a person to a particular statement. This is what the internet\ntends to want to do. - Especially if it's the\nworst thing they ever said. Yeah 'cause God, well, anyone judged by that standard is doomed\nunless they're silent. - But it also just makes\nyou not want to play. Not want to take sort of radical thought\nexperiments and carry out to natural conclusion. - Well that's kind the definition\nof a totalitarian state. No one's playing in a\ntotalitarian state ever. - But in this case it's an emergent one. With psychopaths, roaming the\nlandscape, the barbarians. - Yeah, well, you know, that\nmight be the general pattern of totalitarianism. - Well, in totalitarianism there's usually one psychopath, not multiple. - Yeah, but everyone, well,\neveryone else is complicit, at least in their silence. - Does the study of the pathology of psychopaths online wear on you? - Yes, definitely. - Do you ever consider doing less of that? - Yes, yes, definitely, but you know. Probably I experience most of that on X, but that's also where I\nfind most of my guests. That's also where I get\na sense of the zeitgeist, which is necessary. For example, if you're\ngonna be a podcast host, it's necessary for me to\nmake my lectures on point and up to date to get a\nsampling of the current moment. You have to be of the moment in many ways, to function at a high level. There's a price to be\npaid for that because you're exposed to everything in a sense. - And you can also over\nsample the darkness. - Yeah, yeah, definitely. - And it can make you\nmore and more cynical. It's a danger, right? - Yeah, yeah, well,\nluckily for me, you know, I have many things that\ncounterbalance that, the familial relationships\nwe talked about, the friendships, and then also all of the public things I do are positive. The lecture tours, for example, which I'm on a lot, they're\nbasically 100% positive. So I'm very well buttressed against that darker element.\n- That's great to hear. As a fan in the arena,\nwatching the gladiators fight, your mind is too important\nto be lost to the cynical, to the battles with the abyss. - Well, you have a moral obligation too, to maintain a positive orientation. It's a moral obligation. The future is of course rife with contradictory possibilities. And I suppose in some ways,\nthe more rapid the rate of transformation, the\nmore possibility for good and for evil is making itself\nmanifest at any moment. But it looks like the best way to ensure that the future is everything\nwe wish it would be, is to maintain faith, that that is the direction\nthat will prevail. And I think that's a\nform of moral commitment when it's not just naive optimism. - Well, Jordan, thank\nyou for being courageous and being the light amid the darkness for many, many people. And thank you for once\nagain talking today. - Thanks very much for the invitation and for the conversation. It's much always a pleasure to see you, and you're doing a pretty\ndecent job yourself, about there illuminating dark corners and bringing people upward. I mean, you've got a\nremarkable thing going with your podcast and\nyou're very good at it. - Thank you, Jordan. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Peterson. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you some words from Friedrich Nietzsche. I would like to learn more\nand more to see as beautiful that which is necessary in things. Then I shall be one of those\nwho make things beautiful. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
