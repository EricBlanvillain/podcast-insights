  "full_text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past\nepisodes for the most potent and actionable\nscience-based tools for mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're going to\ntalk about dreaming, learning during dreaming,\nas well as unlearning during dreaming, in particular,\nunlearning of challenging emotional events. Now, numerous people\nthroughout history have tried to make\nsense of dreams in some sort of organized way. The most famous of\nwhich, of course, is Sigmund Freud, who talked\nabout symbolic representations in dreams. A lot of that has\nbeen kind of debunked, although I think that\nthere's some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are. And this is something that\nwe'll talk about in more depth today, although not Freudian\ntheory in particular. So I think in order to\nreally think about dreams and what to do with them and how\nto maximize the dream experience for sake of learning\nand unlearning, the best way to\naddress this is to look at the physiology of sleep,\nto really address, what do we know concretely about sleep? So first of all,\nas we get sleepy, we tend to shut our eyes. And that's because there\nare some autonomic centers in the brain, some neurons\nthat control closing of the eyelids\nwhen we get sleepy. And then we\ntransition into sleep. And sleep, regardless\nof how long we sleep, is generally broken up into\na series of 90-minute cycles, these ultradian cycles. So early in the night, these\n90-minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow\nsleep and slow wave sleep. And we tend to have\nless so-called REM sleep, R-E-M sleep, which stands\nfor Rapid Eye Movement sleep. For every 90-minute cycle that\nwe have during a night of sleep, we tend to start having\nmore and more REM sleep. So more of that 90-minute\ncycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow wave sleep. Now, this is true\nregardless of whether or not you wake up in the\nmiddle of the night to use the restroom or\nyour sleep is broken. The more sleep you're\ngetting across the night, the more REM sleep\nyou're going to have. And REM sleep and non-REM,\nas I'll refer to it, have distinctly different roles\nin learning and unlearning. And they are responsible\nfor learning and unlearning of distinctly different\ntypes of information. And this has\nenormous implications for learning of motor\nskills, for unlearning of traumatic events,\nor for processing emotionally challenging as well\nas emotionally pleasing events. And as we'll see,\none can actually leverage their\ndaytime activities in order to access more slow\nwave sleep or non-REM sleep, as we'll call it, or\nmore REM sleep, depending on your particular emotional\nand physical needs. So it's really a\nremarkable stage of life that we have a lot\nmore control and power over than you might believe. So let's start by\ntalking about slow wave sleep or non-REM sleep. So slow wave sleep\nis characterized by a particular pattern\nof brain activity in which the brain is\nmetabolically active but that there's these big\nsweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain. Now, the interesting thing\nabout slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators\nthat tend to be associated with it, that\nare most active and least active during slow wave sleep. And here's why. To remind you, neuromodulators\nare these chemicals that act rather slowly. But their main role is to\nbias particular brain circuits to be active and other brain\ncircuits to not be active. And they are associated as a\nconsequence with certain brain functions. So we know, for instance,\nand just to review, acetylcholine in waking states\nis a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity\nof brain circuits associated with focus and attention. Norepinephrine is\na neuromodulator that tends to amplify the\nbrain circuits associated with alertness and\nthe desire to move. Serotonin is the\nneuromodulator that's released and tends to amplify\nthe circuits in the brain and body that are associated\nwith bliss and a desire to remain still. And dopamine is\nthe neuromodulator that's released and is\nassociated with amplification of the neural circuits in\nthe brain and body associated with pursuing goals and\npleasure and reward. So in slow wave sleep, something\nreally interesting happens. There's essentially\nno acetylcholine. And acetylcholine,\nas I just mentioned, is associated with focus. So you can think\nof slow wave sleep as these big, sweeping\nwaves of activity through the brain and a kind\nof distortion of space and time so that we're not really\nfocusing on any one thing. Now, the other molecules that\nare very active at that time are norepinephrine, which\nis a little bit surprising. Because normally,\nin waking states, norepinephrine is\ngoing to be associated with a lot of alertness\nand the desire to move. But there's not a ton\nof norepinephrine around in slow wave sleep. But it is around. So there's something associated\nwith the movement circuitry going on in slow wave sleep. And remember, this\nis happening mostly at the beginning of the night. Your sleep is dominated\nby slow wave sleep. So no acetylcholine, very\nlittle norepinephrine, although there is some,\nand a lot of serotonin. And serotonin,\nagain, is associated with this desire, this\nsensation of bliss or well-being but not a lot of movement. And during sleep,\nyou tend not to move. Now, in slow wave\nsleep, you can move. You're not paralyzed. So you can roll over. If people are\ngoing to sleepwalk, typically it's going to\nbe during slow wave sleep. And what studies have\nshown through some kind of sadistic experiments, where\npeople are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep-- and that can be done\nby waking them up as soon as the electrode\nrecordings show that they're in slow wave sleep or\nby chemically altering their sleep so that it biases\nthem away from slow wave sleep. What studies have shown is that\nmotor learning is generally occurring in slow wave sleep. So let's say the day\nbefore you go to sleep, you were learning\nsome new dance move or you were learning\nsome specific motor skill, either a fine motor\nskill or a coarse motor skill. Learning of those skills\nis happening primarily during slow wave sleep, in\nthe early part of the night. In addition, slow\nwave sleep has been shown to be important\nfor the learning of detailed information. So we can think of slow\nwave sleep as important for motor learning,\nmotor skill learning, and for the learning of specific\ndetails about specific events. And this turns out to be\nfundamentally important because now we know that\nslow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night. And motor learning is occurring\nprimarily early in the night. And detail learning is\noccurring early in the night. I want to talk about REM sleep\nor Rapid Eye Movement sleep. REM sleep and Rapid Eye Movement\nsleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night. But you're going to\nhave more of it-- a larger percentage of these\n90-minute sleep cycles is going to be comprised of REM sleep\nas you get toward morning. REM sleep is fascinating. It was discovered in the\n'50s when sleep laboratory in Chicago-- the researchers observed\nthat people's eyes were moving under their eyelids. Now, something very\nimportant that we're going to address when\nwe talk about trauma later is that the eye movements\nare not just side to side. They're very erratic in\nall different directions. One thing that I've\nnever heard anyone really talk about publicly is\nwhy eye movements during sleep. Eyes are closed. And sometimes, people's eyelids\nwould be a little bit open. And their eyes are\ndarting around, especially in little kids. I don't suggest you do this. I'm not even sure it's ethical. But it has been done,\nwhere you pull back the eyelids of a kid\nwhile they're sleeping. And their eyes are kind of\ndarting all over the place. Rapid eye movement\nsleep is fascinating and occurs because\nthere are connections between the brainstem,\nan area called the pons, and areas\nof the thalamus and the top of\nthe brainstem that are involved in\ngenerating movements in different directions,\nsometimes called saccades. Although sometimes during\nrapid eye movement sleep, it's not just rapid. It's kind of a jittery\nside to side thing. And then the eyeballs\nkind of roll. It's really pretty creepy\nto look at if you see. So what's happening there\nis the circuitry that is involved in\nconscious eye movements is kind of going haywire. But it's not haywire. It's these waves of activity\nfrom the brain stem up to the so-called\nthalamus, which is an area that filters\nsensory information and then up to the cortex. And the cortex, of\ncourse, is involved in conscious perceptions. In REM sleep, serotonin\nis essentially absent. So this molecule,\nthis neuromodulator that tends to create the\nfeeling of bliss and well-being and just calm\nplacidity is absent. In addition to that,\nnorepinephrine, this molecule that's involved in movement and\nalertness, is absolutely absent. It's probably one of the\nfew times in our life that epinephrine is\nessentially at zero activity within our system. And that has a number of\nvery important implications for the sorts of dreaming\nthat occur during REM sleep and the sorts of learning\nthat can occur in REM sleep and unlearning. First of all, in REM\nsleep, we are paralyzed. We are experiencing\nwhat's called atonia, which just means\nthat we're completely laid out and paralyzed. We also tend to\nexperience whatever it is that we're dreaming about\nas a kind of hallucination or a hallucinatory activity. So in REM, our eyes are moving. But the rest of our\nbody is paralyzed. And we are hallucinating. There's no epinephrine around. Epinephrine doesn't just create\na desire to move and alertness. It is also the chemical\nsignature of fear and anxiety. It's what's released\nfrom our adrenal glands when we experience something\nthat's fearful or alerting. So if a car suddenly\nscreeches in front of us or we get a troubling\ntext message, adrenaline is deployed\ninto our system. Adrenaline is epinephrine. Those are equivalent molecules. And epinephrine isn't just\nreleased from our adrenals. It's also released\nwithin our brain. So there's this weird\nstage of our life that happens more toward morning\nthat we call REM sleep, where we're hallucinating and having\nthese outrageous experiences in our mind. But the chemical that's\nassociated with fear and panic and anxiety is not\navailable to us. And that turns out\nto be very important. And you can imagine\nwhy that's important. It's important\nbecause it allows us to experience things, both\nreplay of things that did occur as well as elaborate contortions\nof things that didn't occur. And it allows us to experience\nthose in the absence of fear and anxiety. So we have this\nincredible period of sleep in which our experience of\nemotionally laden events is dissociated. It's chemically blocked from\nus having the actual emotion. So to just recap where\nwe've gone so far, slow wave sleep\nearly in the night has been shown to be\nimportant for motor learning and for detailed learning. REM sleep has a certain\ndream component in which there's no epinephrine. Therefore, we can't\nexperience anxiety. We are paralyzed. Those dreams tend to be really\nvivid and have a lot of detail to them. And yet, in REM sleep,\nwhat's very clear is that the sorts of learning\nthat happen in REM sleep are not motor events. It's more about unlearning\nof emotional events. And now, we know why. Because the chemicals\navailable for really feeling those emotions are not present. Now, that has very\nimportant implications. So let's address those\nimplications from two sides. First of all, we\nshould ask, what happens if we don't\nget enough REM sleep? And a scenario that\nhappens a lot where people don't get enough\nREM sleep is the following. I'll just explain\nthe one that I'm familiar with because\nit happens to me a lot, although I've figured\nout ways to adjust. I go to sleep around\n10:30, 11 o'clock. I fall asleep very easily. And then I wake up\naround 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I now know to use a NSDR,\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest protocol. And that allows me\nto fall back asleep. Even though it's called\nnon-sleep deep rest, it really allows me to\nrelax my body and brain. And I tend to fall back asleep\nand sleep till about 7:00 AM, during which time I\nget a lot of REM sleep. And I know this because\nI've measured it. And I know this\nbecause my dreams tend to be very\nintense of the sort that we know is\ntypical of REM sleep. In this scenario, I've\ngotten my slow wave sleep early in the night. And I've got my REM\nsleep toward morning. However, there are times when\nI don't go back to sleep. Maybe I have a flight to catch. That's happened. Sometimes, I've got\na lot on my mind. And I don't go back to sleep. I can tell you--\nand you've probably experienced-- that\nthe lack of REM sleep tends to make people\nemotionally irritable. It tends to make us feel\nas if the little things are the big things. So it's very clear\nfrom laboratory studies where people have been deprived\nselectively of REM sleep that our emotionality tends\nto get a little bit unhinged. And we tend to\ncatastrophize small things. We tend to feel like the\nworld is really daunting. We're never going to\nmove forward in the ways that we want. We can't unlearn the\nemotional components of whatever it is\nthat's been happening, even if it's not traumatic. The other thing that\nhappens in REM sleep is a replay of certain\ntypes of spatial information about where we were and why\nwe were in those places. And this maps to some\nbeautiful data and studies that were initiated by a guy\nnamed Matt Wilson at MIT years ago showing that in rodents. And it turns out in\nnon-human primates and in humans, there's a\nreplay of spatial information during REM sleep that almost\nprecisely maps to the activity that we experienced during the\nday as we move from one place to another. So here's a common\nworld scenario. You go to a new place. You navigate through that\ncity or that environment. This place doesn't have to\nbe at the scale of a city. It can be a new building. It could be a finding particular\nrooms, new social interaction. You experience that. And if it's important\nenough, that becomes solidified\na few days later. And you won't forget it. If it's unimportant,\nyou'll probably forget it. During REM sleep,\nthere's a literal replay of the exact firing\nof the neurons that occurred while you were\nnavigating that same city or building earlier. So REM sleep seems\nto be involved in the generation of this\ndetailed spatial information. But what is it that's actually\nhappening in REM sleep? So there's this\nuncoupling of emotion. But most of all, what's\nhappening in REM sleep is that we're forming\na relationship with particular\nrules or algorithms. We're starting to\nfigure out, based on all the experience that\nwe had during the day, whether or not it's important\nthat we avoid certain people or that we approach\ncertain people, whether or not it's important\nthat, when we enter a building, that we go into the elevator and\nturn left where the bathroom is, for instance-- these general\nthemes of things and locations and how they fit together. And that has a word. It's called meaning. During our day,\nwe're experiencing all sorts of things. Meaning is how we\neach individually piece together the relevance\nof one thing to the next. So if I suddenly told you\nthat this pen was downloading all the information\nto my brain that was important to deliver\nthis information, you'd probably think I was\na pretty strange character because typically we don't\nthink of pens as downloading information into brains. But if I told you that I\nwas getting information from my computer that was\nallowing me to say things to you, you'd say, well,\nthat's perfectly reasonable. And that's because\nwe have a clear and agreed upon association\nwith computers and information and memory. And we don't have that\nsame association with pens. You might say, well, duh. But something in our brain needs\nto solidify those relationships and make sure that the certain\nrelationships don't exist. And it appears that REM\nsleep is important for that. Because when you deprive\nyourself or people of REM, they start seeing\nodd associations. And we know that if people\nare deprived of REM sleep for very long periods of time,\nthey start hallucinating. They literally start seeing\nrelationships and movement of objects that isn't happening. And so REM sleep is really where\nwe establish the emotional load but where we also start\ndiscarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant. And if you think\nabout emotionality, a lot of overemotionality\nor catastrophizing is about seeing\nproblems everywhere. It's very important\nin order to have healthy emotional and\ncognitive functioning that we have fairly\nnarrow channels between individual things. If we see something on the\nnews that's very troubling, well, then it makes sense\nto be very troubled. But if we're troubled\nby everything and we start just saying,\neverything is bothering me and I'm feeling highly\nirritable and everything is just distorting and\ntroubling me, chances are we are not actively\nremoving the meaning, the connectivity between life\nexperiences as well as we could. And that almost always maps\nback to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep seems\nto be where we uncouple the potential\nfor emotionality between various experiences. And that brings us to the\nabsolutely fundamental relationship and\nsimilarity of REM sleep to some of the\nclinical practices that have been designed to\neliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma and\nother troubling experiences. Many of you perhaps have\nheard of trauma treatments such as EMDR, Eye Movement\nDesensitization Reprocessing, or ketamine treatment\nfor trauma, something that recently became\nlegal and is in fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR\nand ketamine at a core level bear very similar\nfeatures to REM sleep. So let's talk about EMDR first. EMDR, Eye Movement\nDesensitization Reprocessing, is something that was developed\nby a psychologist, Francine Shapiro. She actually was in Palo Alto. And the story goes that she\nwas walking not so incidentally in the trees and\nforests behind Stanford. And she was recalling a\ntroubling event in her own mind. So this would be\nfrom her own life. And she realized that\nas she was walking, the emotional load\nof that experience was not as intense or severe. She extrapolated from that\nexperience of walking and not feeling as stressed about the\nstressful event to a practice that she put into work with\nher clients, with her patients, and that now has become\nfairly widespread. It's actually one of the few\nbehaviorally-- the behavior treatments that are approved\nby the American Psychological Association for the\ntreatment of trauma. What she had her\nclients and patients do was move their\neyes from side to side while recounting some\ntraumatic or troubling event. Why eye movements? Well, she never really\nsaid why eye movements. But soon, I'll tell\nyou why the decision to select these\nlateralized eye movements for the work in the\nclinic was the right one. So these eye movements,\nthey look silly. But they basically\ninvolve sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side\nto side for 30 to 60 seconds, then describing this\nchallenging procedure. Now, as a vision\nscientist who also works on stress, when\nI first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly. People would ask me about EMDR. And I just thought,\nthat's crazy. I went and looked up\nsome of the theories about why EMDR might work. And there were a\nbunch of theories. Oh, it mimics the eye\nmovements during REM sleep. That was one. It turns out that's not true. And I'll explain why. The other one was, oh, it\nsynchronizes the activity on the two sides of the brain. Well, sort of. I mean, when you\nlook into both sides of the binocular visual field,\nyou activate the visual cortex. But this whole idea of\nsynchrony between the two sides of the brain\nis something that I think modern\nneuroscience is starting to, let's just say,\ngently or not so gently move away from this whole right\nbrain, left brain business. It turns out, however,\nthat eye movements of the sort that I just did\nand that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience\nand brought to her clients in the clinic are the\nsorts of eye movements that you generate\nwhenever you're moving through space, when\nyou are self-generating that movement. So not so much when\nyou're driving a car. But certainly, if you are riding\na bicycle or you were walking or you were running,\nyou don't realize it. But you have these reflexive\nsubconscious eye movements that go from side to side. And they are associated\nwith the motor system. So when you move forward,\nyour eyes go like this. There have been a number\nof studies showing that these lateralized eye\nmovements helped people move through or dissociate\nthe emotional experience of particular traumas with\nthose experiences such that they could recall those\nexperiences after the treatment and not feel\nstressed about them. Or they didn't report them\nas traumatic any longer. Now, the success\nrate wasn't 100%. But they were\nstatistically significant in a number of studies. In the last five\nyears, there have been no fewer than five\njournals and papers showing that lateralized\neye movements of the sort that I just did-- and if you're just\nlistening to this, it's just moving the eyes from\nside to side with eyes open-- that those eye movements, but\nnot vertical eye movements, suppress the activity\nof the amygdala, which is this brain region\nthat is involved in threat detection,\nstress, anxiety, and fear. There are some forms of fear\nthat are not amygdala dependent. But the amygdala, it's\nnot a fear center. But it is critical\nfor the fear response and for the\nexperience of anxiety. So that's interesting. We've got a clinical\ntool now that indeed shows a lot of success in a\ngood number of people, where eye movements from side to side\nare suppressing the amygdala. And the general theme is to use\nthose eye movements to suppress the fear response and then to\nrecount or repeat the experience and over time uncouple\nthe heavy emotional load-- the sadness, the\ndepression, the anxiety, the fear-- from whatever\nit was that happened that was traumatic. This is important to\nunderstand because I'd love to be able to\ntell somebody who had a traumatic\nexperience that they would forget that experience. But the truth is, you never\nforget the traumatic experience. What you do is you remove\nthe emotional load. Eventually, it really\ndoes lose its potency. The emotional potency\nis alleviated. Now, EMDR, I should\njust mention, tends to be most successful for\nsingle event or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over\nand over as opposed to, say, an entire childhood\nor an entire divorce. It tends to be most\neffective for single event kinds of things-- car\ncrashes, et cetera-- where people can really\nrecall the events in quite a lot of detail. It's not for everybody. It's going to be\ndone for trauma. It should be done in\na clinical setting with somebody who's\ncertified to do this. But that bears a lot of\nresemblance to REM sleep, this experience in our sleep\nwhere our eyes are moving, although in a different way. But we don't have the\nchemical epinephrine in order to generate the fear response. And yet, we're\nremembering the event from the previous day or days. And then now, there's\nthis chemical treatment with the drug ketamine, which\nalso bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things\nthat happen in REM sleep. Ketamine is a\ndissociative anesthetic. It is remarkably\nsimilar to the drug called PCP, which is certainly\na hazardous drug for people to use. Ketamine and PCP both function\nto disrupt the activity of a particular receptor in the\nbrain called the NMDA receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. This is a receptor that's\nin the surface of neurons or on the surface of neurons\nfor which most of the time it's not active. But when something\nvery extreme happens and there's a lot of activity in\nthe neural pathway that impinges on that receptor, it opens. And it allows the\nentry of molecules, ions that trigger a\ncellular process that we call long-term potentiation. And long-term\npotentiation translates to a change in connectivity\nso that later, you don't need that intense\nevent for the neuron to become active again. Ketamine blocks\nthis NMDA receptor. So how is ketamine being used? Ketamine is being used to\nprevent learning of emotions very soon after trauma. Ketamine is being stocked in a\nnumber of different emergency rooms, where if people\nare brought in quickly-- and these are hard\nto describe even-- but a horrible\nexperience of somebody seeing a loved one next to\nthem killed in a car accident and they were driving that car. This isn't for\neverybody, certainly. And you need to talk\nto your physician. But ketamine is being used. So they might infuse\nsomebody with ketamine so that their emotion is-- it can still occur but that\nthe plasticity, the change in the wiring of\ntheir brain won't allow that intense emotion to\nbe attached to the experience. Now, immediately, you can\nimagine the ethical implications of this because\ncertain emotions need to be coupled to experiences. But in the clinical\nsetting, the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies\nare really to remove emotion. Ketamine is about\nbecoming dissociative or removed from the emotional\ncomponent of experience. So now, we have ketamine, which\nchemically blocks plasticity and prevents the connection\nbetween an emotion and an experience. That's a pharmacologic\nintervention. We have EMDR, which is this\neye movement thing that is designed to\nsuppress the amygdala and is designed to remove\nemotionality while somebody recounts an experience. And we have REM sleep, where\nthe chemical epinephrine that allows for signaling of intense\nemotion and the experience of intense emotion in the\nbrain and body is not allowed. And so we're starting to see\nan organizational logic, which is that a certain component\nof our sleeping life is acting like therapy. And that's really what\nREM sleep is about. So we should really\nthink about REM sleep and slow wave sleep as\nboth critical-- slow wave sleep for motor learning\nand detailed learning, REM sleep for\nattaching of emotions to particular experiences,\nand then for making sure that the emotions\nare not attached to the wrong experiences and for\nunlearning emotional responses if they're too\nintense or severe. And this all speaks to\nthe great importance of mastering one sleep,\nsomething that we talked about in episode two of the\npodcast, and making sure that if life has\ndisruptive events, either due to travel or stress\nor changes in school or food schedules, something that we\ntalked about in episodes three and four, that one\ncan still grab a hold and manage one's sleep\nlife because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions\nthat are troubling to us is what allows us to\nmove forward in life. And indeed, the REM\ndeprivation study show that people\nbecome hyper emotional. They start to catastrophize. And it's no surprise, therefore,\nthat sleep disturbances correlate with so many emotional\nand psychological disturbances. By now, it should\njust be obvious why that would be the case. I was in a discussion with a\ncolleague of mine who's down in Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay. I've known her for two\ndecades now from the time she was at Oxford. And Sarah studies, among other\nthings, menopause in the brain. And she was saying that a\nlot of the emotional effects of menopause actually\nare not directly related to the hormones. There have been some\nreally nice studies showing that the disruptions\nin temperature regulation in menopause mapped to\nchanges in sleep regulation that then impact\nemotionality and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits\nrelated to emotionality. So sleep deprivation isn't\njust deprivation of energy. It's not just deprivation\nof immune function. It is deprivation of\nself-induced therapy every time we go to sleep. So these things like EMDR\nand ketamine therapies are in clinic therapies. But REM sleep is the one\nthat you're giving yourself every night when you go to\nsleep, which raises, I think, the other important\nquestion, which is how to get and how to know\nif you're getting the appropriate amount of REM\nsleep and slow wave sleep. Turns out that for sake of\nlearning new information, limiting the variation in\nthe amount of your sleep is at least as important\nand perhaps more important than just getting\nmore sleep overall. I find great relief personally\nin the fact that consistently getting, for me, about 6 hours\nor 6 and 1/2 hours is going to be more beneficial than\nconstantly striving for eight or nine and finding that\nsome nights I'm getting five and sometimes I'm getting nine\nand varying around the mean. Now, ideally, you're getting\nthe full complement of slow wave sleep early and night\nand sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep, which brings\nus how to get more REM sleep. Well, there are a couple\nof different ways. But here's how to not\nget more REM sleep. First of all, drink\na lot of fluid right before going to sleep. One of the reasons why we wake\nup in the middle of the night to use the bathroom is because\nwhen our bladder is full, there is a neural connection,\nliterally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit that goes to\nthe brain stem that wakes us up. So having a full bladder is\none way to disrupt your sleep. The other one is tryptophan or\nanything that contains 5-HTP, which is serotonin or a\nprecursor to serotonin. Serotonin is made\nfrom tryptophan. For some people, those\nsupplements might work. But beware,\nserotonin supplements could disrupt the timing of\nREM sleep and slow wave sleep. Now, if you want to increase\nyour slow wave sleep, that's interesting. There are ways to do that. One of the most powerful\nways to increase the percentage of\nslow wave sleep, apparently without\nany disruption to the other components\nof sleep and learning, is to engage in\nresistance exercise. It's pretty clear that\nresistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic\nand endocrine pathways that lend themselves to release\nof growth hormone, which happens early in the night. And resistance\nexercise therefore can induce a greater\npercentage of slow wave sleep. It doesn't have to be done\nvery close to going to bedtime. In fact, for some\npeople, the exercise could be disruptive\nfor reasons I've talked about in previous episodes. But resistance exercise,\nunlike aerobic exercise, does seem to increase the amount\nof slow wave sleep, which, as we know, is involved in motor\nlearning and the acquisition of fine detailed\ninformation, not general rules or the emotional\ncomponents of experiences. Alcohol-- alcohol and\nmarijuana are well known to induce states that are\npseudo sleep-like, especially when people fall asleep\nafter having consumed alcohol or THC, one of the\nactive components in marijuana. Alcohol, THC, and\nmost things like them, meaning things that\nincrease serotonin or GABA, are going to disrupt\nthe pattern of sleep. They're going to\ndisrupt the depth. They're going to disrupt\nthe overall sequencing of more slow wave sleep early\nin the night and more REM sleep later in the night. That's just the reality. Now, of course, if that's what\nyou need in order to sleep and that's within\nyour protocol-- as I've said here\nbefore, I'm not suggesting people take anything. I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not a cop. So I'm not trying to\nregulate anyone's behavior. I'm just telling you\nwhat the literature says. Today, we've been in a deep\ndive of sleep and dreaming, learning and unlearning. And I just want to recap a few\nof the highlights and important points. A lot more slow wave sleep and\nless REM early in the night. More REM and less slow wave\nsleep later in the night. REM sleep is associated\nwith intense experiences without this chemical\nepinephrine that allows us the anxiety or\nfear and almost certainly has an important role in uncoupling\nof emotion from experiences, kind of self-induced therapy\nthat we go into each night. That bears striking resemblance\nto things like EMDR and ketamine therapies and so forth. Slow wave sleep is\ncritical, however. It's critical mostly for motor\nlearning and the learning of specific details. So REM is kind of emotions and\ngeneral themes and meaning. And slow wave sleep--\nmotor learning and details. I personally find it\nfascinating that consistency of sleep, meaning getting\nsix hours every night is better than getting 10\none night, eight the next, five the next, four the next. I find that fascinating. And I think I also\nlike it because it's something I can control better\nthan just trying to sleep more, which I think I'm not alone\nin agreeing that that's just hard for a lot of people to do. Thank you for joining me in this\njourney of the nervous system and biology and trying to\nunderstand the mechanisms that make us who we are\nand how we function in sleep and in wakefulness. It's really an incredible\nlandscape to consider. And I hope that you're getting\na lot out of the information. As always, thank you for\nyour interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
