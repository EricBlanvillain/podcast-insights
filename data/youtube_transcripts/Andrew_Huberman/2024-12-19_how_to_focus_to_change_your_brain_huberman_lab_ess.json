  "full_text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past\nepisodes for the most potent and actionable\nscience-based tools for mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Andrew\nHuberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we're talking\nabout neuroplasticity, which is this incredible feature\nof our nervous system's that allows it to change in\nresponse to experience. Neuroplasticity is arguably one\nof the most important aspects of our biology. It holds the promise\nfor each and all of us to think differently,\nto learn new things, to forget painful experiences,\nand to essentially adapt to anything that life\nbrings us by becoming better. So let's get started. Most people are familiar with\nthe word \"neuroplasticity,\" which is the brain and nervous\nsystem's ability to change itself. All of us were born\nwith a nervous system that isn't just\ncapable of change but was designed to change. When we enter the world,\nour nervous system is primed for learning. The brain and nervous system of\na baby is wired very crudely. The connections are\nnot precise, and we can see evidence\nof that in the fact that babies are kind of flopping\nthere, like a little potato bug with limbs. They can't really do much in\nterms of coordinated movement. They certainly can't speak,\nand they can't really do anything with precision. So I want you to\nimagine in your mind that when you were\nbrought into this world, you were essentially a widely\nconnected web of connections that was really poor\nat doing any one thing, and that through your\nexperience, what you were exposed to by your parents\nor other caretakers, through your social\ninteractions, through your thoughts, through\nthe languages that you learned, through the places you\ntraveled or didn't travel, your nervous system\nbecame customized to your unique experience. Now, that's true for\ncertain parts of your brain that are involved in what\nwe call representations of the outside world. A lot of your brain is designed\nto represent the visual world, or represent the auditory\nworld, or represent the gallery of smells that\nare possible in the world. However, there are aspects\nof your nervous system that were designed\nnot to be plastic. They were wired so that\nplasticity or changes in those circuits\nis very unlikely. Those circuits include\nthings like the ones that control your heartbeat. The ones that control\nyour breathing. The ones that control\nyour digestion. And thank goodness that\nthose circuits were set up that way, because you want\nthose circuits to be extremely reliable. So many nervous system features,\nlike digestion and breathing and heart rate,\nare hard to change. Other aspects of\nour nervous system are actually quite\neasy to change. And one of the great gifts\nof childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is that\nwe can learn through almost passive experience. We don't have to focus that hard\nin order to learn new things. And then after\nage 25, if we want to change those connections,\nthose superhighways of connectivity, we have to\nengage in some very specific processes. And those processes,\nas we'll soon learn, are gated, meaning\nyou can't just decide to change your brain. You actually have to go\nthrough a series of steps to change your internal\nstate in ways that will allow you to change your brain. Many of us have been\ncaptivated by the stories in the popular press about\nthe addition of new neurons, this idea, oh, if you go\nrunning or you exercise, your brain actually\nmakes new neurons. Well, I'm going to give\nyou the bad news, which is that after puberty, the\nhuman brain and nervous system adds very few, if\nany, new neurons. So even though we can't add new\nneurons throughout our lifespan, at least not in\nvery great numbers, it's clear that we can\nchange our nervous system, that the nervous system\nis available for change, that if we create the\nright set of circumstances in our brain, chemical\ncircumstances, and if we create the right\nenvironmental circumstances around us, our\nnervous system will shift into a mode in which\nchange isn't just possible, but it's probable. As I mentioned\nbefore, the hallmark of the child nervous\nsystem is change. It wants to change. One of the ways in which\nwe can all get plasticity at any stage\nthroughout the lifespan is through deficits\nand impairments in what we call our sensory\napparati-- our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth. In individuals that\nare blind from birth, the so-called occipital cortex,\nthe visual cortex in the back, becomes overtaken by hearing. The neurons there will start\nto respond to sounds as well as Braille touch. And actually, there is one\nparticularly tragic incident where a woman who\nwas blind since birth and, because of\nneuroimaging studies, we knew her visual cortex\nwas no longer visual. It was responsible for Braille\nreading and for hearing. She had a stroke that\nactually took out most of the function\nof her visual cortex. So then she was blind, she\ncouldn't Braille read, or hear. She did recover some\naspect of function. Now, most people, they don't end\nup in that highly unfortunate situation. And what we know is that, for\ninstance, blind people who use their visual cortex for\nBraille reading and for hearing have much better\nauditory acuity and touch acuity, meaning they can sense\nthings with their fingers and they can sense\nthings with their hearing that typical sighted\nfolks wouldn't be able to. In fact, you will find\na much greater incidence of perfect pitch in\npeople that are blind. And that tells us that the brain\nand, in particular, this area we call the neocortex,\nwhich is the outer part, is really designed to be a\nmap of our own individual experience. So these, what I\ncall experiments of impairment or\nloss, where somebody is blind from birth\nor deaf from birth or maybe has a limb development\nimpairment where they have a stump instead of an entire\nlimb with a functioning hand, their brain will represent the\nbody plan that they have, not some other body plan. But the beauty of the situation\nis that the real estate up in the skull, that\nneocortex, the essence of it is to be a customized\nmap of experience. A few years ago,\nI was at a course, and a woman came up to me\nand she said, you know, I-- I wasn't teaching the course. I was in the course. And she said, I just\nhave to tell you that every time you speak,\nit really stresses me out. And I said, well, I've\nheard that before. But do you want to\nbe more specific? And she said, yeah,\nyour tone of voice reminds me of somebody that I\nhad a really terrible experience with. I said, well, OK, well,\nI can't change my voice, but I really appreciate\nthat you acknowledge that. And it also will\nhelp explain why you seem to cringe\nevery time I speak, which I hadn't\nnoticed until then. But after that, I\ndid notice she had a very immediate and kind of\nvisceral response to my speech. But in any event, over the\nperiod of this two-week course, she would come back every\nonce in a while and say, you know what? I think just by telling you that\nyour voice was really difficult for me to listen\nto, it's actually becoming more tolerable to me. And by the end, we actually\nbecame pretty good friends, and we're still in touch. And so what this says is that\nthe recognition of something, whether or not that's an\nemotional thing or a desire to learn something else,\nis actually the first step in neuroplasticity. If I get up out of this chair\nand walk out of the door, I don't think about each\nstep that I'm taking. And that's because I learned\nhow to walk during development. But when we decide\nthat we're going to shift some sort of\nbehavior or some reaction or some new piece of information\nthat we want to learn is something that we want to\nbring into our consciousness, that awareness is\na remarkable thing because it cues the brain and\nthe rest of the nervous system that when we engage in those\nreflexive actions going forward, that those reflexive actions are\nno longer fated to be reflexive. Now, if this sounds a\nlittle bit abstract, we're going to talk about\nprotocols for how to do this. But the first step\nin neuroplasticity is recognizing that you\nwant to change something. We have to know what it is\nexactly that we want to change. Or if we don't know exactly what\nit is that we want to change, we at least have to know that\nwe want to change something about some specific experience. Now, there are\nspecific protocols that science tells us\nwe have to follow if we want those changes to occur. What it is, is\nit's our forebrain, in particular our\nprefrontal cortex, signaling the rest\nof our nervous system that something that we're about\nto do, hear, feel, or experience is worth paying attention to. So we'll pause there, and then\nI'm going to move forward. One of the biggest lies\nin the universe that seems quite prominent right now\nis that every experience you have changes your brain. People love to say this. They love to say,\nyour brain is going to be different\nafter this lecture, or your brain is going to be\ndifferent after today's class than it was two days ago. And that's absolutely not true. The nervous system\ndoesn't just change because you experience\nsomething unless you're a very young child. The nervous system changes\nwhen certain neurochemicals are released and\nallow whatever neurons are active in the period in\nwhich those chemicals are swimming around to\nstrengthen or weaken the connections\nof those neurons. So when people tell you, oh,\nat the end of today's lecture, at the end of\nsomething, your brain is going to be completely\ndifferent, that's simply not true. If you're older\nthan 25, your brain will not change unless\nthere's a selective shift in your attention or a selective\nshift in your experience that tells the brain\nit's time to change. And those changes occur through\nstrengthening and weakening of particular connections. But the important\nthing to understand is that if we want\nsomething to change, we really need to bring an\nimmense amount of attention to whatever it is that\nwe want to change. This is very much\nlinked to the statement I made earlier about it all\nstarts with an awareness. Now, why is that\nattention important? In the early '90s, a graduate\nstudent by the name of Gregg Recanzone was in the laboratory\nof a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF. And they set out\nto test this idea that if one wants to\nchange their brain, they need to do it early in life\nbecause the adult brain simply isn't plastic. It's not available\nfor these changes. And they did a series\nof absolutely beautiful experiments, by\nnow, I think we can say proving that the\nadult brain can change, provided certain\nconditions are met. Now, the experiments\nthey did are tough. They were tough on\nthe experimenter, and they were tough\non the subject. I'll just describe one. Let's say you were a subject\nin one of their experiments. You would come into the lab,\nand you'd sit down at a table, and they would record\nfrom or image your brain and look at the representation\nof your fingers, the digits, as we call them. And there would be a spinning\ndrum, literally like a stone drum in front of you, or metal\ndrum, that had little bumps. Some of the bumps were spaced\nclose together, some of them were spaced far apart. And they would do\nthese experiments where they would\nexpect their subjects to press a lever whenever, for\ninstance, the bumps got closer together or further apart. And these were very\nsubtle differences. So in order to do\nthis, you really have to pay attention to the\ndistance between the bumps. And these were not\nBraille readers or anyone skilled in doing these\nkinds of experiments. What they found\nwas that as people paid more and more\nattention to the distance between these bumps-- and they would\nsignal when there was a change by pressing a lever. As they did that, there\nwas very rapid changes, plasticity in the\nrepresentation of the fingers. And it could go in\neither direction. You could get people\nvery good at detecting the distance between bumps that\nthe distance was getting smaller or the distance was\ngetting greater. So people could get very\ngood at these tasks that are kind of hard\nto imagine how they would translate to the real\nworld for a non-Braille reader. But what it told us is\nthat these maps of touch were very much available\nfor plasticity, and these were fully\nadult subjects. What it proved is that the\nadult brain is very plastic. And they did some beautiful\ncontrol experiments that are important for\neveryone to understand, which is that sometimes\nthey would bring people in and they would have\nthem touch these bumps on this spinning drum, but\nthey would have the person pay attention to an auditory cue. Every time a tone\nwould go off or there was a shift in the\npitch of that tone, they would have to signal that. So the subject thought\nthey were doing something related to touch and hearing. And all that showed\nwas that it wasn't just the mere action of\ntouching these bumps; they had to pay attention\nto the bumps themselves. If they were placing their\nattention on the auditory cue, on the tone, well,\nthen there was plasticity in the auditory\nportion of the brain, but not on the touch\nportion of the brain. And this really spits in\nthe face of this thing that you hear so often,\nwhich is, every experience that you have is going to\nchange the way your brain works. Absolutely not. The experiences that you pay\nsuper careful attention to are what open up plasticity,\nand it opens up plasticity to that specific experience. So the question then is, why? And Merzenich and his\ngraduate students and postdocs went on to address\nthis question of why. And it turns out, the answer\nis a very straightforward neurochemical answer. And the first neurochemical is\nepinephrine, also adrenaline. We call it adrenaline when it's\nreleased from the adrenal glands above our kidneys. That's in the body. We call it epinephrine\nin the brain, but they are chemically\nidentical substances. Epinephrine is released from a\nregion in the brainstem called locus ceruleus. Epinephrine is released\nwhen we pay attention and when we are alert. But the most important\nthing for getting plasticity is that there be\nepinephrine, which equates to alertness, plus the\nrelease of this neuromodulator acetylcholine. Now, acetylcholine is released\nfrom two sites in the brain. One is also in the brainstem,\nand it's named different things in different animals. But in humans, the most rich\nsite of acetylcholine neurons, or neurons that\nmake acetylcholine, is the parabigeminal nucleus\nor the parabrachial region. All you need to know is that you\nhave an area in your brainstem, and that area sends wires,\nthese axons, up into the area of the brain that\nfilters sensory input. So we have this area of the\nbrain called the thalamus, and it is getting bombarded\nwith all sorts of sensory input all the time. But when I pay\nattention to something, I create a cone of attention,\nand what we call signal to noise goes up. So those of you with an\nengineering background will be familiar\nwith signal to noise. Those of you who do not have\nan engineering background, don't worry about it. All it means is that one\nparticular shout in the crowd comes through. Acetylcholine acts\nas a spotlight. But epinephrine for alertness,\nacetylcholine spotlighting these inputs, those\ntwo things alone are not enough to\nget plasticity. There needs to be\nthis third component, and the third component\nis acetylcholine released from an area\nof the forebrain called nucleus basalis. If you really want\nto get technical, it's called nucleus\nbasalis of Meynert. For any of you that are\nbudding physicians or going to medical school,\nyou should know that. If you have acetylcholine\nreleased from the brainstem, acetylcholine released\nfrom nucleus basalis, and epinephrine, you\ncan change your brain. And this has been shown\nagain and again and again in a variety of\npapers, and it is now considered a fundamental\nprinciple of how the nervous system works. If you can access these\nthree things of epinephrine, acetylcholine from\nthese two sources, not only will the nervous\nsystem change, it has to change. It absolutely will change. And that is the\nmost important thing for people to understand if\nthey want to change their brain. So now let's talk about\nhow we would translate all this scientific\ninformation into some protocols that you can actually apply\nbecause I think that's what many of you are interested in. What you do with your health and\nyour medical care is up to you. You're responsible for\nyour health and well-being. So I'm not going to tell you\nwhat to do or what to take, I'm going to describe what the\nliterature tells us and suggests about ways to access plasticity. We know we need epinephrine. That means alertness. Most people accomplish this\nthrough a cup of coffee and a good night's sleep. So I will say you should\nmaster your sleep schedule, and you should figure out how\nmuch sleep you need in order to achieve alertness when\nyou sit down to learn. But once that's in\nplace, the question then is, how do I\naccess this alertness? Well, there are\na number of ways. Some people use some pretty\nelaborate psychological gymnastics. They will tell\npeople that they're going to do something and\ncreate some accountability. That could be really good. Or they'll post a picture\nof themselves online, and they'll commit to\nlearning a certain amount-- losing, excuse me, a certain\namount of weight or something like this. So they can use either\nshame-based practices to potentially\nembarrass themselves if they don't follow through. They'll write checks\nto organizations that they hate and\ninsist that they'll cash them if they don't\nactually follow through. Or they'll do it out of love. They'll decide that they're\ngoing to run a marathon or learn a language or something\nbecause of somebody they love, or they want to\ndevote it to somebody. The truth is that from the\nstandpoint of epinephrine and getting alert and activated,\nit doesn't really matter. Epinephrine is a\nchemical, and your brain does not distinguish\nbetween doing things out of love or hate, anger, or fear. It really doesn't. All of those promote\nautonomic arousal and the release of epinephrine. So I think for most\npeople, if you're feeling not motivated to make\nthese changes, the key thing is to identify not just one, but\nprobably a kit of reasons, several reasons as\nto why you would want to make this particular change. And being drawn toward\na particular goal that you're excited\nabout can be one. Also being motivated to not\nbe completely afraid, ashamed, or humiliated for not following\nthrough on a goal is another. Come up with two\nor three things, fear-based, perhaps, love-based,\nperhaps, or perhaps several of those in order to ensure\nalertness, energy, and attention for the task. And that brings us to\nthe attention part. Now, it's one thing to\nhave an electrode embedded into your brain and increase\nthe amount of acetylcholine. It's another to exist\nin the real world outside the laboratory and have\ntrouble focusing, having trouble bringing your attention to a\nparticular location in space for a particular event. And there's a lot of discussion\nnowadays about smartphones and devices creating a\nsort of attention deficit, almost at a clinical level for\nmany people, including adults. I think that's largely true. And what it means,\nhowever, is that we all are responsible for learning\nhow to create depth of focus. There are some important\nneuroscience principles to get depth of focus. I want to briefly talk\nabout the pharmacology first because I always get\nasked about this. People say, what can\nI take to increase my levels of acetylcholine? Well, there are\nthings you can take. Nicotine is called nicotine\nbecause acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor. There are two kinds of\nacetylcholine receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic. But the nicotinic\nones are involved in attention and alertness. I have colleagues-- these are\nnot my kind of like bro science buddies. I have those friends, too. This is a Nobel\nPrize-winning colleague who chews Nicorette while he works. But when I asked him,\nwhy are you doing this, he said, well, it increases\nmy alertness and focus. Now, I've tried\nchewing Nicorette. It makes me super jittery. I don't like it because\nI can't focus very well. It kind of takes me too far up\nthe level of autonomic arousal. I've got friends that\ndip Nicorette all day. If you're going to\ngo down that route, you want to be very\ncareful how much you rely on those all the time because\nthe essence of plasticity is to create a window\nof attention and focus that's distinct from\nthe rest of your day. So what are some ways that you\ncan increase acetylcholine? How do you increase focus? The best way to get\nbetter at focusing is to use the mechanisms of\nfocus that you were born with. And the key principle\nhere is that mental focus follows visual focus. We are all familiar\nwith the fact that our visual system can be\nunfocused, blurry, or jumping around, or we can be\nvery laser-focused on one location in space. What's interesting and vitally\nimportant to understanding how to access\nneuroplasticity is that you can use your visual\nfocus, and you can increase your\nvisual focus as a way of increasing your mental\nfocus abilities more broadly. So I'm going to\nexplain how to do that. Plasticity starts\nwith alertness. That alertness can come from a\nsense of love, a sense of joy, a sense of fear. Doesn't matter. There are pharmacologic ways\nto access alertness, too. The most common one is,\nof course, caffeine. Many people are now\nalso using Adderall. Adderall will not\nincrease focus. It increases alertness. It does not touch the\nacetylcholine system. The acetylcholine system\nand the focus that it brings is available, as I mentioned,\nthrough pharmacology, but also through these\nbehavioral practices. And the behavioral\npractices that are anchored in\nvisual focus are going to be the ones that are going to\nallow you to develop great depth and duration of focus. So let's think about\nvisual focus for a second. When we focus on something\nvisually, we have two options. We can either look at a\nvery small region of space with a lot of detail\nand a lot of precision, or we can dilate\nour gaze and we can see big pieces of visual\nspace with very little detail. It's a trade-off. We can't look at everything\nat high resolution. This is why we have these. The pupil more or less\nrelates to the fovea of the eye, which is the area\nin which we have the most receptors, the highest\ndensity of receptors that perceive light. And so our acuity is\nmuch better in the center of our visual field\nthan in our periphery. When we focus our eyes,\nwe do a couple of things. First of all, we tend\nto do that in the center of our visual field,\nand our two eyes tend to align in what's\ncalled a vergence eye movement towards a common point. The other thing that happens\nis the lens of our eye moves, so that our brain,\nnow, no longer sees the entire visual\nworld, but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery. That small cone\nof visual imagery, or soda straw view of the world,\nhas much higher acuity, higher resolution, than if I were\nto look at everything. Now you say, of course,\nthis makes perfect sense. But that's about visual\nattention, not mental attention. Well, it turns out\nthat focus in the brain is anchored to\nour visual system. I'll talk about blind\npeople in a moment. But assuming that\nsomebody is sighted, the key is to learn how to\nfocus better visually if you want to bring about higher\nlevels of cognitive or mental focus. When we move our eyes\nslightly inward-- maybe you can tell that I'm\ndoing this-- like so, basically shortening or making the\ninterpupillary distance, as it's called, smaller,\ntwo things happen. Not only do we develop a smaller\nvisual window into the world, but we activate a set\nof neurons in our brain stem that trigger the release\nof both norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine. Norepinephrine is kind of\nsimilar to epinephrine. So in other words,\nwhen our eyes are relaxed in our head,\nwhen we're just kind of looking at our\nentire visual environment, moving our head around,\nmoving through space, we're in optic flow,\nthings moving past us, we're sitting still, we're\nlooking broadly at our space, we're relaxed. When our eyes move\nslightly inward toward a particular\nvisual target, our visual world shrinks, our\nlevel of visual focus goes up, and we know that this relates\nto the release of acetylcholine and epinephrine at\nthe relevant sites in the brain for plasticity. Now, what this means is that if\nyou have a hard time focusing your mind for sake of\nreading or for listening, you need to practice--\nand you can practice-- focusing your visual system. Now, this works\nbest if you practice focusing your visual system\nat the precise distance from the work that you intend\nto do for sake of plasticity. So how would this look\nin the real world? Let's say I am trying to\nconcentrate on something related to, I don't know, science. I'm reading a science paper\nand I'm having a hard time. It's not absorbing. Spending just 60 to 120 seconds\nfocusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen,\nmeaning just on my screen with nothing on it,\nbut bringing my eyes to that particular\nlocation increases not just my visual acuity\nfor that location, but it brings about an\nincrease in activity in a bunch of other\nbrain areas that are associated with gathering\ninformation from this location. So, put simply, if you want to\nimprove your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, you may ask, well,\nwhat about the experiment where people were feeling\nthis rotating drum or listening to\nthe auditory cue? That does involve vision at all. Ah. If you look at people\nwho are learning things with their auditory system, they\nwill often close their eyes. And that's not a coincidence. If somebody is\nlistening very hard, please don't ask them to\nlook you directly in the eye while also asking that\nthey listen to you. That's actually one\nof the worst ways to get somebody\nto listen to you. If you say, now listen to\nme and look me in the eye, the visual system will take over\nand they'll see your mouth move, but they're going to hear their\nthoughts more than they're going to hear what you're saying. Closing the eyes is\none of the best ways to create a cone of\nauditory attention. And this is what low-vision\nor no-vision folks do. They have tremendous capacity\nto focus their attention in particular locations. And for most people,\nvision is the primary way to train up this focus ability\nand these cones of attention. So you absolutely have\nto focus on the thing that you're trying\nto learn, and you will feel some agitation\nbecause of the epinephrine in your system. If you're feeling agitation\nand it's challenging to focus and you're feeling like\nyou're not doing it right, chances are you're\ndoing it right. So once you get this\nepinephrine, this alertness, you get the acetylcholine\nreleased and you can focus your attention, then\nthe question is, for how long? And in an earlier\npodcast, I talked about these ultradian cycles\nthat last about 90 minutes. The typical learning bout\nshould be about 90 minutes. I think that learning bout will\nno doubt include 5 to 10 minutes of a warm-up period. I think everyone\nshould give themselves permission to not\nbe fully focused in the early part of that\nbout, but that in the middle of that bout for the\nmiddle hour or so, you should be able to maintain\nfocus for about an hour or so. So that, for me, means\neliminating distractions. That means turning\noff the Wi-Fi. I put my phone in\nthe other room. I encourage you to\ntry experiencing what it is to be completely\nimmersed in an activity where you feel the agitation\nthat your attention is drifting, but you continually\nbring it back. And that's an important point,\nwhich is that attention drifts, but we have to re-anchor it. We have to keep\ngrabbing it back. And the way to do that,\nif you're sighted, is with your eyes, that as your\nattention drifts and you look away, you want to\ntry and literally maintain visual\nfocus on the thing that you're trying to learn. That's the trigger\nfor plasticity. But the real secret is\nthat neuroplasticity doesn't occur\nduring wakefulness, it occurs during sleep. We now know that if you\nfocus very hard on something for about 90 minutes\nor so, maybe you even do several bouts\nof that per day, if you can do that--\nsome people can. Some people can only do one\nfocus bout of learning-- that night and the following\nnights while you sleep, the neural circuits that were\nhighlighted, if you will, with acetylcholine\ntransmission, will strengthen. And other ones\nwill be lost, which is wonderful because that's\nthe essence of plasticity. And what it means is\nthat when you eventually wake up a couple of\ndays or a week later, you will have acquired\nthe knowledge forever, unless you go through some\nprocess to actively unlearn it. So mastering sleep\nis key in order to reinforce the\nlearning that occurs. But let's say you get a\nreally poor night of sleep after a bout of learning. Chances are, if you sleep the\nnext night or the following night, that learning will occur. There's a stamp in the brain\nwhere this acetylcholine was released. It actually marks those\nsynapses neurochemically and metabolically so that\nthose synapses are more biased to change. Now, if you don't ever\nget that deep sleep, then you probably won't\nget those changes. There is also a way\nin which you can bypass the need for\ndeep sleep, at least partially, by engaging in what\nI call non-sleep deep rest, these NSDR protocols. But I just want to discuss\nthe science of this. There was a paper\nthat was published in Cell Reports last year that\nshows that if people did-- it was a spatial memory task,\nactually quite difficult one, where they had to remember the\nsequence of lights lighting up. And if there were just\ntwo or three lights in a particular\nsequence, it's easy. But as you get up to 15\nor 16 lights and numbers in the sequence, it actually\ngets quite challenging. If immediately after-- and\nit was immediately after the learning, the actual\nperformance of this task, people took a 20-minute\nnon-sleep deep-rest protocol or took a shallow nap, so lying\ndown, feet slightly elevated, perhaps, just closing their\neyes, no sensory input, the rates of learning were\nsignificantly higher for that information than were they to\njust had a good night's sleep the following night. So you can actually\naccelerate learning with these NSDR protocols or\nwith brief naps, 90 minutes or less. For many people,\nletting the mind drift, where it's not\norganized in thought, after a period of very\ndeliberate, focused effort, is the best way to accelerate\nlearning and depth of learning. I want to synthesize\nsome of the information that we've covered up until now. Today, I want to make sure\nthat these key elements that form the backbone\nof neuroplasticity are really embedded\nin people's minds. First of all, plasticity\noccurs throughout the lifespan. If you want to learn as an\nadult, you have to be alert. It might seem so obvious,\nbut I think a lot of people don't think about when in their\n24-hour cycle they're most alert. Just ask yourself\nwhen during the day do you typically tend\nto be most alert? That will afford\nyou an advantage in learning specific things\nduring that period of time. So don't give up\nthat period of time for things that are meaningless,\nuseless, or not aligned with your goals. That epinephrine released\nfrom your brain stem is going to occur more readily\nat particular phases of your 24-hour\ncycle than others-- during the waking\nphase, of course. You should know when those are. Increasing acetylcholine can be\naccomplished pharmacologically through nicotine. However, there are certain\ndangers for many people to do that, as well as a cost. financial cost. Learning how to engage\nthe cholinergic system through the use of\nthe visual system. Practicing; how long\ncan you maintain focus with blinks as you need them. But how long can you maintain\nvisual focus on a target, just on a piece of paper set\na few feet away in the room, or at the level of\nyour computer screen. These are actually\nthings that people do in communities where\nhigh levels of visual focus are necessary. What we're really\ntalking about here is trying to harness the\nmechanisms of attention and get better at\npaying attention. You may want to do that with\nyour auditory system, not with your visual system,\neither because you're low-vision or no-vision,\nor because you're trying to learn something\nthat relates more to sounds. You should also ask\nyourself whether or not you're trying to focus too much\nfor too long during the day. I know some very\nhigh-performing individuals, very high-performing in\na variety of contexts, and none of them are\nfocused all day long. Many of them take\nwalks down the hallway, sometimes mumbling to themselves\nor not paying attention to anything else. They go for bike\nrides, they take walks. They are not trying to engage\ntheir mind at maximum focus all the time. Very few people do that because\nwe learn best in these 90-minute bouts inside of one of\nthese ultradian cycles. And I should repeat again that\nwithin that 90-minute cycle, you should not expect yourself\nto focus for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle. The beginning and end are\ngoing to be a little bit flickering in and out of focus. How do you know when one of\nthese 90-minute cycles is starting? Well, typically when you wake\nup is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle, but it's\nnot down to the minute. You'll be able to tap into your\nsense of these 90-minute cycles as you start to engage in\nthese learning practices, should you choose. And then, of course, getting\nsome non-sleep deep rest or just deliberate\ndisengagement, such as walking or\nrunning or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open, kind\nof mindlessly, it might seem, in a chair. Just letting your\nthoughts move around after a learning\nbout will accelerate the rate of plasticity. And then, of course, deep sleep.
