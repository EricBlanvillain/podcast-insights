  "full_text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past\nepisodes for the most potent and actionable\nscience-based tools for mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's podcast episode is\nabout jet lag, shift work. And we are going to\ndiscuss protocols that are backed by\nscience that can support particular tools that you can\nuse to combat things like jet lag, offset some of the\nnegative effects of shift work, and make life easier\nfor the new parent, as well as for\nthe newborn child, the adolescent, anyone\nthat wants to sleep better, feel better when they're\nawake, et cetera. Let's just take a\nstep back for a moment and remind everybody\nwhat we're talking about. The circadian rhythm is a\n24-hour rhythm in all sorts of functions. The most prominent\none is a rhythm in our feelings of\nwakefulness and sleepiness. You also have a rhythm in\nsleepiness and wakefulness that correlates with that. We tend to be sleepy as\nour temperature is falling, getting lower. And we tend to be more\nawake or waking when our temperature is increasing. We have a clock over the roof\nof our mouth, a group of neurons called the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus. That clock generates\na 24-hour rhythm. And that clock is\nentrained, meaning, it is matched to the external\nlight-dark cycle, which is, no surprise, 24 hours. Spinning of the\nEarth takes 24 hours. So our cells, our\norgans, our wakefulness, our temperature, but\nalso our metabolism, our immune system,\nour mood, all of that is tethered to the\noutside light-dark cycle. And if we are living our life in\na perfect way, where we wake up in the morning, and\nwe view sunlight as it crosses the horizon,\nand then by evening we catch a little sunlight,\nand then at night, we're in complete\ndarkness, we will be, more or less, perfectly matched\nto the external or ambient light-dark cycle. Very few of us do that\nbecause of these things that we call artificial\nlights and this other thing that we call life demands. So today, we're going to talk\nabout when we get pulled away from that rhythm. So what is the perfect day? What does that look like from\na circadian sleep-wakefulness standpoint? You basically want to get as\nmuch light, ideally, sunlight, but as much light into your\neyes during the period of each 24-hour cycle when\nyou want to be awake, when you want to be alert. And you want to get as\nlittle light into your eyes at the times of that 24-hour\ncycle when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep. How much is enough? Well, a good number to shoot\nfor, as a rule of thumb, is to try and get exposure to\nat least 100,000 lux before 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, maybe,\nbut before 9:00 AM, assuming you're waking up\nsometime between 5:00 and 8:00 AM. The mechanism of\ncircadian clock setting involves these\nneurons in your eye that send electrical\nsignals to this clock above the roof of your mouth. And that system sums,\nmeaning, it adds photons. It's a very slow system. So here, we're talking about\ntrying to get that at least 100,000 photons,\nbut not all at once. So what do you do? You go outside. Going outside, even on a cloudy\nday, could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really\nremarkable how bright it is, meaning, how much photon\nenergy is coming through. So try and get 100,000\nlux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't\ndo that because you live in an area of the\nworld where it's just not bright enough, some people have\nsent me pictures from Northern England, it's just not bright\nenough in winter, then sure, you can resort to using\nartificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000\nlux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can, in theory, get it\nall from artificial lights, but there are some special\nqualities about sunlight that make sunlight\nthe better stimulus. Then I've recommended, based\non scientific literature, that you look at sunlight\nsometime around the time when the sun is setting. And the reason for\nthat, of course, is because it adjusts down\nthe sensitivity of your eyes. Because here's the\ndiabolical thing-- while we need a lot of photon\nenergy early in the day to wake up our system and set our\ncircadian clock and prepare us for a good night's sleep\n14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon\nenergy to reset and shift our clock after 8:00 PM. And that's why you want to,\nas much as you safely can, avoid bright light and even\nnot so bright light between the hours of 10:00 or\n11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. So let's talk about\nshifting clocks, because for the\njet-lagged person, this ability to shift the\nclock with light temperature, exercise, and food is\nvitally important for getting onto the new local schedule. And there's so much out\nthere about jet lag. Today, I'm going to dial it down\nto one very specific parameter that all of you can figure\nout without any technology or devices and can apply for\nwhen you travel for work, or pleasure, or anytime\nyou're jet-lagged. And I want to\nabsolutely emphasize that you don't have to\ntravel to get jet-lagged. Many of you are jet-lagged. You're jet-lagged\nbecause you're looking at your phone in the\nmiddle of the night. You're jet-lag because\nyou're waking up at different times a day. Your jet-lagged because you're\nexercise is on a chaotic regime, some days at this time,\nsome days at that time. But there are some simple\nthings that you can do. So that's where we're headed. Let's talk about\nwhat jet lag is. There are quality,\npeer-reviewed papers, showing that jet lag\nwill shorten your life. Jet lag is a serious thing. Now, here's what's interesting. Traveling westward on\nthe globe is always easier than traveling eastward. OK? It's interesting because the\neffects of jet lag on longevity have shown that traveling East\ntakes more years off your life than traveling West. Now, here's what's interesting. When we think about the\neffects of jet lag on longevity or this idea that it\ncan shorten our lives, we have to ask ourselves, why? Why is that? And it turns out, there's\na pretty simple explanation for this. We've talked before about\nthe autonomic nervous system, this set of neurons\nin our spinal cord, and body, and brain that\nregulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness. It turns out that human beings\nand probably, most species, are better able to\nactivate and stay alert than they are to shut\ndown their nervous system and go to sleep on demand. So if you really have to\npush, and you really have to stay awake, you can do it. You can stay up later. But falling asleep\nearlier is harder. And that's why\ntraveling East has a number of different\nfeatures associated with it that because\nyou're traveling East, you're trying to\ngo to bed earlier. As a Californian, if\nI go to New York City, I've got to get to\nbed three hours early and wake up three hours\nearlier, much harder than coming back to\nCalifornia and just staying up a few more hours. And this probably has roots\nin evolutionary adaptation, where under conditions where\nwe need to suddenly gather up and go, or forage\nfor food, or fight, or do any number of\ndifferent things, that we can push ourselves\nthrough the release of adrenaline and\nepinephrine to stay awake, whereas being able to slow down\nand deliberately fall asleep is actually much harder to do. So there's an asymmetry to\nour autonomic nervous system that plays out in the\nasymmetry of jet lag. All right. Well, let's think about\ntravel and what happens. Let's say, you're not\ngoing eastward or westward, but you're going North or South. So if you go from, for instance,\nWashington, DC to Santiago, Chile, you're just\ngoing North and South. You're not really moving\ninto a different time zone. You're not shifting. So you will experience\ntravel fatigue. And it turns out that jet\nlag has two elements-- travel fatigue and time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag is\nsimply the inability of local sunlight\nand local darkness to match to your internal\nrhythm, this endogenous rhythm that you have. So before we get too\ncomplicated and too down in the weeds about this,\nI want to just throw out a couple important things. First of all, some people\nsuffer from jet lag a lot, other people, not so much. Most people experience worse\njet lag as they get older. There are reasons for that,\nbecause early in life, patterns of\nmelatonin release are very stable and flat and very\nhigh, actually, in children. Then it becomes cyclic\nduring puberty, meaning, it comes on once every 24 hours\nand turns off once every 24 hours. And then as we get older, the\ncycles get more disrupted. And we become more vulnerable to\neven small changes in schedule, et cetera, meal times. So jet lag gets worse as we age. I want to make changing\nyour internal rhythm really easy, or at least,\nas easy and as simple as one could possibly\nmake it, I believe. What I want to talk\nabout is perhaps, one of the most\nimportant things to know about your body and brain,\nwhich is called your temperature minimum. Your temperature minimum is the\npoint in every 24-hour cycle when your temperature is lowest. Now, how do you measure\nthat without a thermometer? It tends to fall 90\nminutes to 2 hours before your average waking time. Temperature, actually,\nis the signal by which this clock above\nthe roof of your mouth, in trains or collectively,\npushes all the cells and tissues of our body to\nbe on the same schedule. Temperature is the effector. And once you hear\nthat, there should be an immediate, of course,\nbecause how else would you get all these\ndifferent diverse cell types to follow one pattern? A pancreatic cell does\nsomething very different than a spleen cell or a neuron. They're all doing different\nthings at different rates. So the temperature\nsignal can go out. And then each one of those can\ninterpret the temperature signal as one unified and consistent\ntheme of their environment. Here's the deal. If you expose your eyes to\nbright light in the four hours after your temperature\nminimum, your circadian clock will shift so that you\nwill tend to get up earlier and go to sleep earlier\nin the subsequent days. It's what's called a phase\nadvance, if you'd like to read up on this further. You advance your clock. However, if you\nview bright light in the four to six hours before\nyour temperature minimum, you will tend to phase\ndelay your clock. You will tend to wake up\nlater and go to sleep later. I tend to wake up at about 6:00\nAM, sometimes, 6:30, sometimes, 7:00. It depends a lot on what I was\ndoing the night before, as I'm guessing it does for you. But that means that my\ntemperature minimum is probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM,\nwhich means that if I wake up at 4:30 AM, and I were to\nview bright light at 4:35 AM, I'm going to advance my clock. I'm going to want to go to bed\nearlier the subsequent night and wake up earlier\nthe subsequent morning. And as I shift my wake up\ntime, my temperature minimum shifts too. If I were to view bright light\nin the four to six hours before 4:30 AM, guess what,\nthe next night, I'm going to want\nto stay up later. And I'm going to want to wake\nup later the subsequent morning. Your temperature minimum\nis a reference point, not a temperature reading. Again, if you want to measure\nyour temperature minimum and figure out what it is,\n98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine. You can do that. But that information\nwon't help you. What you need to know is what\ntime your body temperature is lowest, and understand that\nin the four hours or so just after that time,\nviewing light will advance your clock to make\nyou want to get up earlier. So now, you can start\nto see and understand the logic of this system. You can now start to shift\nthat temperature according to your travel needs. Here's one way in which\nyou might do that. Let's say, I am going\nto travel to Europe, which is nine hours ahead,\ntypically, from California. I would want to determine my\ntemperature minimum, which, for me, is about 4:30\nAM, maybe 5:00 AM. And I would want to start\ngetting up at about 5:30 AM and getting some bright\nlight exposure, presumably, from artificial sources because\nthe sunlight isn't going to be out at that time, maybe\neven exercising as well, maybe even eating a\nmeal at that time. You would want to start\ndoing that two or three days before travel, because\nonce I land in Europe, chances are, just viewing the\nsunrise or sunset in Europe is not going to allow me to\nshift my circadian clock. Some people say, get sunlight\nin your eyes when you land, but that's not going to work,\nbecause one of two things is likely to happen. With a nine-hour\nshift like that, either I'm going\nto view sunlight at a time that corresponds\nto the circadian dead zone, the time in which my circadian\nclock can't be shifted, or I'm going to end up viewing\nsunlight at a time that corresponds to the\nfour to six hour window before my temperature minimum. So it's going to shift me in\nexactly the opposite direction that I want to go. So it can be very, very\nchallenging for people to adjust to jet lag. So you need to ask, am\nI traveling East or am I traveling West? Am I trying to advance my\nclock or delay my clock? Remember, viewing light,\nexercise, and eating in the four to six hours\nbefore your temperature minimum will delay your clock. Eating, viewing\nsunlight, and exercising, you don't have to do all three,\nbut some combination of those, in the four to six hours after\nyour temperature minimum, will advance your clock. And this is a powerful\nmechanism by which you can shift your\nclock anywhere from one to three hours per day,\nwhich is remarkable. That means your\ntemperature minimum is going to shift out as\nmuch as three hours, which can make it such that you can\ntravel all the way to Europe. And in as long as you've\nprepared for a day or so, by doing what I\ndescribed, back home, and then doing it\nwhen you arrive, you can potentially accomplish\nthe entire shift within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. And so a lot of people\nare landing in Europe, getting sunlight in\ntheir eyes, and throwing their clock out of whack, or\nnot shifting their clock at all. This brings me to the other\nthing that's highly recommended, and I've mentioned\nthis before, but you want to eat on the\nlocal meal schedule. If it's in your\npractice to fast, fast. That's fine. But when you eat, you want to\neat within the local schedule for alertness. OK. I talked about\ntraveling eastward, but we haven't talked\nabout traveling westward. Let's say, you're traveling\nfrom New York to California or from Europe to California. The challenge there tends to be,\nhow can you stay up late enough? Now, some people\nare able to do this, because, as I mentioned earlier,\nthe autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired\nsuch that it's easier to stay up later than we\nwould naturally want to, than it is to go\nto sleep earlier. So let's say, you land. And it's 4:00 PM. And you're just dying. You're in California. You came from Europe. It's 4:00 PM. And you really, really\nwant to go to sleep. That's where the use of things\nlike caffeine, exercise, and sunlight can shift you. If it's after your\ntemperature peak, then viewing sunlight\naround 6:00 PM, or 8:00 PM, or artificial light, if\nthere isn't sunlight, will help shift you later. It's going to delay your clock. And you're going to be\nable to stay up later. The worst thing\nyou can do is take a nap that was intended to\nlast 20 minutes or an hour. I do this routinely. And then wake up four\nhours later, or you wake up and it's midnight, and you\ncan't fall back asleep. You really want to\navoid doing that. So provided, it's not\nexcessive amounts, stimulants like caffeine\nin coffee or tea can really help you push\npast that afternoon barrier and get you to sleep more\nlike on the local schedule and eating on the\nlocal schedule as well. A number of people have asked\nabout the use of melatonin to induce sleepiness. Melatonin is this hormone that's\nreleased from the pineal gland. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin during\ndevelopment is also responsible for timing the\nsecretion of certain hormones that are vitally\nimportant for puberty. Does melatonin control\nthe onset of puberty? Not directly, but indirectly. Melatonin inhibits\nsomething called gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone, which is a hormone that's released\nfrom your hypothalamus, also roughly above the roof of\nyour mouth in your brain. Gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone is really interesting because it stimulates the\nrelease of another hormone called luteinizing hormone,\nwhich, in females, causes estrogen to be released\nwithin the ovaries, it's involved in\nreproductive cycles, and in males, stimulates\ntestosterone from the Sertoli cells of the testes. Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,\nGonadotropin-Releasing Hormone, and therefore, is\ninhibitory to LH, Luteinizing Hormone,\nand therefore, is inhibitory to\ntestosterone and estrogen. Just no two ways about it. So melatonin is used widely\nfor inducing sleepiness when you want to fall\nasleep in the new location that you've arrived. You can't fall asleep. You take melatonin. And it helps you fall asleep. It does not help\nyou stay asleep. In addition to that, melatonin\nhas been touted as the best way to shift your circadian clock. I'm happy to go\non record, saying, look, if you need melatonin. And you can work with a\ndoctor or somebody who really understands circadian\nand sleep biology, go for it if that's your thing. But as always on this\npodcast and elsewhere, I have a bias toward\nbehavioral things that you can\ntitrate and control, like exposure to light,\nexercise, temperature, et cetera, that have much\nbigger margins for safety and certainly, don't have\nthese other endocrine effects that we've been thinking\nabout and talking about. So if you want to take\nmelatonin in the afternoon in order to fall asleep, or\nin the evening, be my guest. That's up to you. Again, you're responsible\nfor your health, not me. But for many people,\nmelatonin is not going to be the best solution. The best solution is going to be\nto use light, and temperature, and exercise on either side\nof the temperature minimum to shift your clock,\nboth before your trip and when you land in\nyour new location, and your clock starts to shift. OK. So now, my opinions\nabout melatonin. Feel free to filter them\nthrough your own opinions and experiences with melatonin. And now, you also understand\nwhat your temperature minimum is and how it represents\nan important landmark, either side of which, you\ncan use light temperature and exercise to\nshift your clock. Just to remind you a little\nbit about temperature, if you want to shift your clock,\nyou can take a hot shower. And then that will\nhave a cooling effect after the hot shower. And if you were to get into\na cold shower or an ice bath, if you have access to\none, afterward, there's going to be a thermogenic\neffect of your body, increasing temperature. So you can start to play\nthese games with timing and hot and cold, with\nmeals, whether or not you eat or you don't eat,\nand with light exposure, whether or not you view light\nor you don't view light. So now, you can start\nto see why understanding the core mechanics of\na system can really give you the most flexibility. And that really underscores\nthe most important thing is that when you\nunderstand mechanism, it's not about being\nneurotically attached to a specific protocol,\nit's the opposite. It can give you great\nconfidence and flexibility in being able to shift your\nbody rhythms however you want. And when things\nget out of whack, you can tuck them\nright back into place. One thing that's common is that\npeople need to do a quick trip. It's not always\nthat you're going to go on vacation for two weeks\nor work someplace else for weeks on end. If your trip is\n48 hours or less, stay on your home schedule. 72, that's when you start\nrunning into trouble. The transit time\nis also important, but I would say, if\nit's three days or less, stay on your home schedule\nas much as you can. So let's talk a little bit about\na different form of jet lag that requires no planes,\nno trains, no automobiles, and that's shift work. Shift work is becoming\nincreasingly common. Many of us are shift working,\neven though we don't have to. We're doing work in the\nmiddle of the night. We are working on our\ncomputers at odd hours, sleeping during the day. Here's the deal with shift work. If there's one rule of\nthumb for shift work, it's that if at\nall possible, you want to stay on the same\nschedule for at least 14 days, including weekends. Now, that should immediately\ncue the non-shift workers to the importance\nof not getting too far off track on\nthe weekend, even if you're not a shift worker. So sleeping in on Sunday\nis not a good idea. The most important\nthing about shift work is to stay consistent\nwith your schedule. If you're going to work a\nshift, where, let's say, you start at 4:00 PM and you\nend at 2:00 AM, excuse me, then there are some important\nquestions that arise. For instance, should you\nsee light during your shift? Well, this is a matter\nof personal choice, but ideally, you want to view\nas much light as possible and as safely possible\nwhen you need to be alert. So that would mean from\n4:00 PM to 2:00 AM. And then you would\nwant to sleep. So using light as a\ncorrelate of alertness and using darkness as a\ncorrelate of sleepiness, what this means is,\nsee as much light as you safely can during\nthe phase of your day when you want to be awake. So let's say, you get home after\nthis 4:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift. You maybe eat something. You go to sleep. And you wake up. And it's noon or 1:00 PM. Should you get\nlight in your eyes? You guessed it. You need to know your\ntemperature minimum. You need to know whether or not\nyour temperature is increasing or decreasing. And now, we can make this\nwhole thing even simpler and just say, if your\ntemperature is decreasing, avoid light. If your temperature is\nincreasing, get light. It's that simple. I'm going to pause there. And then I want to talk\nabout kids and the elderly. In other words,\nhow do we control sleep, and circadian\nrhythms, and wakefulness in babies, adolescents,\nteens, and aged folks? All right. As I mentioned earlier,\nmelatonin is not cyclic. It's not cycling in babies. It's more phasic. It's being released\nat a constant level. And babies tend to be smaller\nthan adults, they are. And so those concentrations\nof melatonin are very high. As a baby grows, those\nconcentrations per unit volume are going to go down. Babies are not born with a\ntypical sleep-wake cycle. And now, all the parents\nare saying, tell me something I didn't know. Perhaps, the most\nimportant thing, if you're having to map\nto a baby's schedule in order to make sure that\nthey're getting changings and nursing, et cetera,\nat the appropriate times, if you can't sleep or you\ncan't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your\nautonomic nervous system in a place where you're\nnot going into heightened states of alertness when you\nwould ideally be sleeping. Now, I realize that this could\nbe translated to try and stay calm while you're\nsleep-deprived, which is very hard for people to do. But this is where the\nnon-sleep deep rest protocols surface again, and\ncan potentially be very beneficial\nfor people to be able to recover, not\nnecessarily, sleep, but for them to maintain\na certain amount of autonomic regulation. Last night, I woke up. I went to bed about 10:30. I woke up at 3:00\nin the morning. I knew I wasn't feeling rested. I did a NSDR protocol. I fell back asleep. I woke up at 6:30. You need to teach your brain\nand your nervous system how to turn off your\nthoughts and go to sleep. And ideally, you do\nthat without medication, unless there's a real need. You do that through these\nbehavioral protocols. They work, because they\ninvolve using the body to shift the mind, not\ntrying to just turn off your thoughts in the\nmiddle of the night. Similar circumstances can\narise if you're taking care of a very sick loved one. You're up all night. Try and stay calm\nusing NSDR protocols. I know it's harder\nto do than to say, but those protocols are there. They're free. There's research\nto support them. Try and get sleep\nwhenever you can, but also try to get morning sunlight and\nevening sunlight in your eyes if you can. And if you can't get that,\nuse artificial light. Once again, I've thrown a\ntremendous amount of information at you. I hope you will figure out\nyour temperature minimum and start working with that to\naccess the sleep and wakeful cycles that you want to access. I hope that you'll explore NSDR. You have now access\nto a lot of mechanism about sleep and wakefulness. I really believe that as\nwe drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms,\nand you start hearing some of the same\nthemes again and again, you're going to start\nto develop an intuition and an understanding of\nhow these systems work in you and your particular\nlife circumstances. So know your\ntemperature minimum. Understand, light in the early\npart of the day is valuable. Light when you want to be awake,\nprovide it's not so bright, it's damaging. It's great for\nyou, whether or not it comes from\nscreens or sunlight, but sunlight is better. Avoid light in the four to six\nhours before your temperature minimum, or else, you're\ngoing to delay your clock, unless you're traveling, and\nthat's what you want to do. OK? Use temperature. Increase temperature\nto shift your clock. Decrease temperature\nto delay your clock. Thanks so much for your\ntime and attention. I really appreciate it. See you next time on the\nHuberman Lab podcast. And as always, thanks for\nyour interest in science. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
